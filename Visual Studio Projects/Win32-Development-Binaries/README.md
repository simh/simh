# Simh Development Binaries

This repository contains binaries for the Windows platform built at least once per week if any changes have been made to the source archive during that week.

The files contained here should run on all versions of Windows starting with XP.

If issues are noticed with the behavior of any simulator, please create an issue at https://github.com/simh/simh/issues describing the problem, or send a note to the simh mailing list.  Please be sure to identify which binary demonstrates the issue and which commit introduced the problem.
