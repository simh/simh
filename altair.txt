Altair 8800 Simulator
=====================

1. Background.

	The MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems) Altair 8800
was announced on the January 1975 cover of Popular Electronics, which
boasted you could buy and build this powerful computer kit for only $397.
The kit consisted at that time of only the parts to build a case, power
supply, card cage (18 slots), CPU card, and memory card with 256 *bytes* of
memory.  Still, thousands were ordered within the first few months after the
announcement, starting the personal computer revolution as we know it today.

	Many laugh at the small size of the that first kit, noting there
were no peripherals and the 256 byte memory size.  But the computer was an
open system, and by 1977 MITS and many other small startups had added many
expansion cards to make the Altair quite a respectable little computer. The
"Altair Bus" that made this possible was soon called the S-100 Bus, later
adopted as an industry standard, and eventually became the IEE-696 Bus.

2. Hardware

	We are simulating a fairly "loaded" Altair 8800 from about 1977,
with the following configuration:

	device		simulates
	name(s)

	CPU		Altair 8800 with Intel 8080 CPU board, 62KB
			of RAM, 2K of EPROM with start boot ROM.
	2SIO		MITS 88-2SIO Dual Serial Interface Board. Port 1
			is assumed to be connected to a serial "glass
			TTY" that is your terminal running the Simulator.
	PTR		Paper Tape Reader attached to port 2 of the
			2SIO board.
	PTP		Paper Tape Punch attached to port 2 of the
			2SIO board.  This also doubles as a printer
			port.
	DSK		MITS 88-DISK Floppy Disk controller with up
			to eight drives.

2.1 CPU

	We have 2 CPU options that were not present on the original
machine but are useful in the simulator.  We also allow you to select
memory sizes, but be aware that some sample software requires the full
64K (i.e. CP/M) and the MITS Disk Basic and Altair DOS require about
a minimum of 24K.

	SET CPU 8080	Simulates the 8080 CPU (normal)
	SET CPU Z80	Simulates the later Z80 CPU [At the present time
			this is not fully implemented and is not to be
			trusted with real Z80 software]
	SET CPU ITRAP	Causes the simulator to halt if an invalid 8080
			Opcode is detected.
	SET CPU NOITRAP	Does not stop on an invalid Opcode.  This is 
			how the real 8080 works.
	SET CPU 4K
	SET CPU 8K
	SET CPU 12K
	SET CPU 16K
	  ......
	SET CPU 64K	All these set various CPU memory configurations.
			The 2K EPROM at the high end of memory is always
			present and will always boot.

The BOOT EPROM card starts at address 177400.  Jumping to this address
will always boot drive 0 of the floppy controller.  If no valid bootable
software is present there the machine crashes.  This is historically
accurate behavior.

The real 8080, on receiving a HLT (Halt) instruction, freezes the processor
and only an interrupt or CPU hardware reset will restore it.  The simulator
is alot nicer, it will halt but send you back to the simulator command line.

CPU Registers include the following:

	name	size	comments
	
	PC	16	The Program Counter
	A	8	The accumulator
	BC	16	The BC register pair.  Register B is the high
			8 bits, C is the lower 8 bits
	DE	16	The DE register pair.  D is the top 8 bits, E is
			the bottom.
	HL	16	The HL register pair.  H is top, L is bottom.
	C	1	Carry flag.
	Z	1	Zero Flag.
	AC	1	Auxillary Carry flag.
	P	1	Parity flag.
	S	1	Sign flag.
	SR	16	The front panel switches.
	BREAK	16	Breakpoint address (377777 to disable).
	WRU	8	The interrupt character.  This starts as 005
			(ctrl-E) but some Altair software uses this
			keystroke so best to change this to something
			exotic such as 035 (which is Ctl-]).


2.2 The Serial I/O Card (2SIO)

	This simple programmed I/O device provides 2 serial ports to the
outside world, which could be hardware jumpered to support RS-232 plugs or a
TTY current loop interface.  The standard I/O addresses assigned by MITS
was 20-21 (octal) for the first port, and 22-23 (octal) for the second.
We follow this standard in the Simulator.

	The simulator directs I/O to/from the first port to the screen. The
second port reads from an attachable "tape reader" file on input, and writes
to an attachable "punch file" on output.  These files are considered a
simple stream of 8-bit bytes.  

2.3 The 88-DISK controller.

	The MITS 88-DISK is a simple programmed I/O interface to the MITS
8-inch floppy drive, which was basically a Pertec FD-400 with a power
supply and buffer board builtin.  The controller supports neither interrupts
nor DMA, so floppy access required the sustained attention of the CPU.
The standard I/O addresses were 10, 11, and 12 (octal), and we follow the
standard.  Details on controlling this hardware are in the altair_dsk.c
source file.


3. Sample Software

	Running an Altair in 1977 you would be running either MITS Disk
Extended BASIC, or the brand new and sexy CP/M Operating System from Digital
Research.  Or possibly, you ordered Altair DOS back when it was promised in
1975, and are still waiting for it to be delivered in early 1977.

	We have samples of all three for you to check out.  We can't go into
the details of how they work, but we'll give you a few hints.


3.1 CP/M Version 2.2

	This version is my own port of the standard CP/M to the Altair. 
There were some "official" versions but I don't have them.  None were
endorsed or sold by MITS to my knowledge, however.
	To boot CP/M:

	sim> attach dsk0 altcpm.dsk
	sim> go 177400
	62K CP/M VERSION 2.2 (ALTAIR 8800)
	A>DIR

	CP/M feels like DOS, sort of.  DIR will work.  I have included all
the standard CP/M utilities, plus a few common public-domain ones.  I also
include the sources to the customized BIOS and some other small programs.
TYPE will print an ASCII file.  DUMP will dump a binary one.  LS is a better
DIR than DIR.  ASM will assemble .ASM files to Hex, LOAD will "load" them to
binary format (.COM).  ED is a simple editor, #A command will bring the
source file to the buffer, T command will "type" lines, L will move lines,
E exits the editor.  20L20T will move down 20 lines, and type 20.  Very
DECish.  DDT is the debugger, SUBMIT is a batch-type command processor. 
A sample batch file that will assemble and write out the bootable CP/M
image (on drive A) is "SYSGEN.SUB".  To run it, type "SUBMIT SYSGEN".


3.2 MITS Disk Extended BASIC Version 4.1

	This was the commonly used software for serious users of the Altair
computer.  It is a powerful (but slow) BASIC with some extended commands to
allow it to access and manage the disk.  There was no operating system it
ran under.  To boot:

	sim> attach dsk0 mbasic.dsk
	sim> go 177400

	MEMORY SIZE? [return]
	LINEPRINTER? C [return]
	HIGHEST DISK NUMBER? 0 [return]  (3 here = 4 drive system)
	NUMBER OF FILES? 3 [return]
	NUMBER OF RANDOM FILES? 2 [return]

3.3 Altair DOS Version 1.0

	This was long promised but not delivered until it was almost
irrelevant.  A short attempted tour will reveal it to be a dog, far inferior
to CP/M.  To boot:

	sim> attach dsk0 altdos.dsk
	sim> go 177400

	MEMORY SIZE? 64 [return]
	INTERRUPTS? N [return]
	HIGHEST DISK NUMBER? 0 [return]  (3 here = 4 drive system)
	HOW MANY DISK FILES? 3 [return]
	HOW MANY RANDOM FILES? 2 [return]
