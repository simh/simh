;   This is a super simple simh script to test the IMP RTC and verify that it is
; incrementing at the correct 100us interval.  It simply waits for the clock
; count to overflow (which takes 65535 * 100us or about 6.5 seconds) and then
; repeats for a total of 10 iterations.  If all is well, this loop should take
; pretty close to 65 seconds to complete.
