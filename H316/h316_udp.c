   OVERVIEW

   This module emulates low level communications between two virtual modems
   using UDP packets over the modern network connections.  It's used by both 
   the IMP modem interface and the host interface modules to implement IMP to 
   IMP and IMP to HOST connections.

   TCP vs UDP

   Why UDP and not TCP?  TCP has a couple of advantages after all - it's
   stream oriented, which is intrinsically like a modem, and it handles all
   the network "funny stuff" for us.  TCP has a couple of problems too - first,
   it's inherently asymmetrical.  There's a "server" end which opens a master
   socket and passively listens for connections, and a "client" end which
   actively attempts to connect.  That's annoying, but it can be worked around.

   The big problem with TCP is that even though it treats the data like a stream
   it's internally buffering it, and you really have absolutely no control over
   when TCP will decide to send its buffer.  Google "nagle algorithm" to get an
   idea.  Yes, you can set TCP_NODELAY to disable Nagle, but the data's still
   buffered and it doesn't fix the problem.  What's the issue with buffering?
   It introduces completely unpredictable delays into the message traffic.  A
   transmitting IMP could send two or three (or ten or twenty!) messages before
   TCP actually decides to try to deliver them to the destination.

   And it turns out that IMPs are extraordinarily sensitive to line speed.  The
   IMP firmware actually goes to the trouble of measuring the effective line
   speed by using the RTC to figure out how long it takes to send a message.
   One thing that screws up the IMP to no end is variation in the effective
   line speed.  I guess they had a lot of trouble with AT&T Long Lines back in
   the Old Days, and the IMP has quite a bit of code to monitor line quality.
   Even fairly minor variations in speed will cause it to mark the line as
   "down" and sent a trouble report back to BBN. And no, I'm not making this up!

   UDP gives us a few advantages.  First, it's inherently packet oriented so
   we can simply grab the entire packet from the transmitting IMP's memory, wrap
   a little extra information around it, and ship it off in one datagram.  The
   receiving IMP gets the whole packet at once and it can simply BLT it into
   the receiving IMP's memory.  No fuss, no muss, no need convert the packet
   into a stream, add word counts, wait for complete packets, etc.  And UDP is
   symmetrical - both ends listen and send in the same way. There's no need for
   master sockets, passive (server) and active (client) ends, or any of that.

   Also UDP has no buffering - the packet goes out on the wire when we send it.
   The data doesn't wait around in some buffer for TCP to decide when it wants
   to let it go.  The latency and delay for UDP is much more predictable and
   consistent, at least for local networks.  If you're actually sending the
   packets out on the big, wide, Internet then all bets are off on that.

   UDP has a few problems that we have to worry about.  First, it's not
   guaranteed delivery so just because one IMP sends a packet doesn't mean that
   the other end will ever see it.  Surprisingly that's not a problem for us.
   Phone lines have noise and dropouts, and real modems lose packets too.  The
   IMP code is completely happy and able to deal with that, and generally we
   don't worry about dropped packets at all.

   There are other issues with UDP - it doesn't guarantee packet order, so the
   sending IMP might transmit packets 1, 2 and 3 and the receiving IMP will get
   1, 3 then 2.  THAT would never happen with a real modem and we have to shield
   the IMP code from any such eventuality.  Also, with UDP packets can be 
   duplicated so the receiving IMP might see 1, 2, 2, 3 (or even 1, 3, 2, 1!).
   Again, a modem would never do that and we have to prevent it from happening.
   Both cases are easily dealt with by adding a sequence number to the header
   we wrap around the IMP's packet.  Out of sequence or duplicate packets can
   be detected and are simply dropped.  If necessary, the IMP will deal with
   retransmitting them in its own time.

   One more thing about UDP - there is no way to tell whether a connection is
   established or not and for that matter there is no "connection" at all 
   (that's why it's a "connectionless" protocol, after all!).  We simply send
   packets out and there's no way to know whether anybody is hearing them. The
   real IMP modem hardware had no carrier detect or other dataset control
   functions, so it was identical in that respect. An IMP sent messages out the
   modem and, unless it received a message back, it had no way to know whether
   the IMP on the other end was hearing them.  


   INTERFACE

   This module provides a simplified UDP socket interface.  These functions are
   implemented -

        udp_create      define a connection to the remote IMP
        udp_release     release a connection
        udp_send        send an IMP message to the other end
        udp_receive     receive (w/o blocking!) a message if available

   Note that each connection is assigned a unique "handle", a small integer,
   which is used as an index into our internal connection data table.  There
   is a limit on the maximum number of connections available, as set my the
   MAXLINKS parameter.  Also, notice that all links are intrinsically full
   duplex and bidirectional - data can be sent and received in both directions
   independently.  Real modems and host cards were exactly the same.
