The files in and below this directory are the necessary glue and stubs 
to allow the effectively unmodified qemu slirp code to be used in simh 
as a network connection mechanism.

Most of the include files here started from related files in the qemu
include directories and have been chopped up and tweaked as necessary
so that the slirp code can be used outside of qemu.

Slirp depends on a small set of capabilities from glib (GArrays mostly).

All of the other include files exist so that the references in the 
slirp code don't have to be modified.
