This memorandum documents SIMH simulators.  These simulators are freeware;
refer to the license terms above for conditions of use.  Support is not
available.  The best way to fix problems or add features is to read and
modify the sources yourself.  Alternately, you can send Internet mail to
bob AT supnik DOT org, but a response is not guaranteed.

The simulators use a common command interface.  This memorandum describes
the features of the command interface.  The details of each simulator are
documented in separate, machine-specific memoranda.

1. Compiling And Running A Simulator

The simulators have been tested on VAX VMS, Alpha VMS, Alpha UNIX,
NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, Solaris, Windows 9x/Me/NT/2000, MacOS
9 and X, and OS/2.  Porting to other environments will require changes
to the operating system dependent code in the SIMH libraries (sim_fio.c,
sim_timer.c, sim_console.c, sim_ether.c, sim_sock.c).

The simulator sources are provided in a zip archive and are organized
hierarchically.  Source files for the simulator libraries are in the
top level directory; source files for each simulator are in individual
subdirectories.  Note that the include files in the top level directory
are referenced from the subdirectories, without path identifiers.  Your
build tool needs to search the top level directory for include files not
found in the simulator-specific directory, or you will have to copy all
files from the subdirectories into the master directory.  File manifests
for each simulator are given in that simulator's documentation.

The simulators recognize or require a few compile-time #defines:

- The 18b simulators require that the model name be defined as part
  of the compilation command line (i.e., PDP4 for the PDP-4, PDP7
  for the PDP-7, PDP9 for the PDP-9, PDP15 for the PDP-15).

- The PDP-10 simulator uses 64b integer variables, requiring that
  USE_INT64 be defined as part of the compilation command line.
  Since 64b integer declarations vary, sim_defs.h has conditional
  declarations for Windows (_int64) and Digital UNIX (long).  The
  default is GNU C (long long).  If your compiler uses a different
  convention, you will have to modify sim_defs.h.

- The PDP-10, PDP-11, and VAX simulators share common peripherals.
  To distinguish the target system, one of three variables must be
  defined on the command line: VM_PDP10 for the PDP-10; VM_PDP11
  for the PDP-11; or VM_VAX for the VAX.

- The PDP-11, PDP-11, and VAX simulators optionally support Ethernet.
  To include Ethernet emulation, USE_NETWORK must be defined as part
  of the compilation command line.  At present, Ethernet support has
  been tested only on Windows, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD,
  Solaris, and Alpha VMS, but it should work in any host environment
  that supports the Pcap library (see the Ethernet readme file).

- The PDP-11 and VAX simulators optionally support disks and serial
  devices files greater than 2GB.  To include large device support,
  both USE_INT64 and USE_ADDR64 must be defined as part of the
  compilation command line.

- The HP2100 Fast FORTRAN Processor (FFP) option requires 64b integer
  support.  Define HAVE_INT64 (not USE_INT64) as part of the compilation
  command line if your host compiler supports 64b integers.  On systems
  without 64b support, the extended-precision instructions (e.g., XADD)
  will be disabled; the remainder of the FFP instructions will work
  normally.  There may be some compilation warnings.

To start the simulator, simply type its name.  (On version of VMS
prior to 6.2, the simulators must then be defined as foreign commands
in order to be be started by name.)  The simulator recognizes one
switch, -Q; if specified, certain informational messages are suppressed.

The simulator interprets the arguments on the command line, if any,
as the file name and arguments for a DO command:

	% pdp10 {<startup file> {arg,arg,...}}(cr)

If no file is specified on the command line, the simulator looks for
an startup file consisting of the simulator name (including its path
components) plus the extension .ini.  If a startup file is specified,
either on the command line or implicitly via the .ini capability, it
should contain a series of non-interactive simulator command, one
per line.  These command can be used to set up standard parameters,
for example, disk sizes.

After initializing its internal structures and processing the startup
file (if any), the simulator types out its name and version and then
prompts for input with:

	sim>

1.1 Compiling Under UNIX/Linux

The sources originate on a Windows system and have cr-lf at the end of
every line.  For use on UNIX or Mac, the sources must be converted to
UNIX text conventions.  This can be done with the UNIX UNZIP utility
(unzip -a).

The supplied makefile will compile the simulators for UNIX systems
which support the POSIX TERMIOS.  The VAX and PDP-11 can be compiled
with or without Ethernet support.  To compile without Ethernet support:

	gmake {target|ALL|clean}

To compile with Ethernet support:

	gmake USE_NETWORK=1 {target|ALL|clean}

Notes for hand compilation:

- The default UNIX terminal handling model is the POSIX TERMIOS
  interface, which is supported by Linux, Mac OS/X, and Alpha UNIX.
  If your UNIX only supports the BSD terminal interface, BSDTTY
  must be defined as part of the compilation command line.

- The PDP-8, PDP-11, 18b PDP, PDP-10, and Nova simulators use the
  math library.  If your UNIX does not link the math library
  automatically, you must add -lm to the compilation command line.

Examples:

- PDP-11 under TERMIOS UNIX:

	% cc -DVM_PDP11 pdp11_*.c scp.c sim_*.c -lm -o pdp11

- PDP-9 under TERMIOS UNIX:

	% cc -DPDP9 pdp18b_*.c scp.c sim_*.c -lm -o pdp9

- PDP-10 under BSD terminal UNIX:

	% cc -DVM_PDP10 -DUSE_INT64 -DBSDTTY pdp10_*.c scp.c sim_*.c -lm -o pdp10

1.2 Compiling Under Windows

1.2.1 Compiling PDP-11 and VAX with Ethernet Support

The Windows-specific Ethernet code uses the WinPCAP 3.0 package.
This package for windows simulates the libpcap package that is freely
available for Unix systems.

WinPCAP must be installed prior to building the PDP-11 and VAX
simulators with Ethernet support.

- Download V3.0 from http://winpcap.polito.it.
- Install the package as directed.
- Copy the required .h files (bittypes.h, devioctl.h, ip6_misc.h,
  packet32.h, pcap.h, pcap-stdinc.h) from the WinPCAP 3.0 developer's
  kit to the top level simulation directory.
- Get the required .lib files (packet.lib, wpcap.lib) from the WinPCAP
  3.0 developer's kit.  If you're using Borland C++, use COFF2OMF to
  convert the .lib files into a format that can be used by the compiler.
  Then move the libraries to the standard library directory.
- Add -DUSE_NETWORK to the compilation command lines for the PDP-11
  and VAX.

1.2.2 Compiling Under MinGW

MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) is a free C compiler available from
http://www.mingw.org.  The distribution includes a batch file
(build_mingw.bat) that will build all the simulators from source.
By default, the PDP-11 and VAX are built without Ethernet support.  To
enable Ethernet support, install WinPCAP as described in the previous
section, and then use the alternative batch file (build_mingw_ether.bat).

1.2.3 Compiling Under Visual C++

Each simulator must be organized as a separate Visual C++ project. 
Starting from an empty console application,

- Add all the files from the simulator file manifest to the project.
- Open the Project->Settings dialog box.
- On the C/C++ tab, Category: General, add any required preprocessor
  definitions (for example, USE_INT64).
- On the C/C++ tab, Category: Preprocessor, add the top level
  simulation directory to the Additional Include Directories.  For
  the VAX and PDP-10, you must also add the PDP-11 directory.
- On the Link tab, add wsock32.lib at the end of the list of
  Object/Module Libraries.
- If you are building the PDP-11 and VAX with Ethernet support, you
  must also add the WinPCAP libraries (packet.lib, wpcap.lib) to the
  list of Object/Module libraries.

If you are using Visual C++ .NET, you must turn off /Wp (warn about
potential 64b incompatibilities); otherwise, the compilations will
generate a lot of spurious conversion warnings.

1.2.4 Compiling Under Borland C++

The Borland C++ compiler generates lots of spurious warnings about
missing function prototypes and conversions.  All of these warnings
can be safely ignored.

1.3 Compiling Under OpenVMS

Compiling on OpenVMS requires DEC C.  The simulators that require
64b (PDP-10 and VAX) will not compile on OpenVMS/VAX.  The SIMH
distribution includes an MMS command file descrip.mms that will
build all the simulators from source.  An example of hand compilation:

- PDP-8 under VMS:

	$ cc scp.c,sim_*.c,[.pdp8]pdp8*.c
	$ link/exec=pdp8 scp.obj,sim_*.obj,[.pdp8]pdp8*.obj

1.4 Compiling Under MacOS

The simulators have been tested on both MacOS 9 (with Codewarrior)
and MacOS/X (with Apple's tools).

1.5 Compiling Under OS/2

Socket support requires the EMX compiler.

2. Simulator Conventions

A simulator consists of a series of devices, the first of which is
always the CPU.  A device consists of named registers and one or more
numbered units.  Registers correspond to device state, units to device
address spaces.  Thus, the CPU device might have registers like PC,
ION, etc, and a unit corresponding to main memory; a disk device might
have registers like BUSY, DONE, etc, and units corresponding to individual
disk drives.  Except for main memory, device address spaces are simulated
as unstructured binary disk files in the host file system.  The SHOW
CONFIG command displays the simulator configuration.

A simulator keeps time in terms of arbitrary units, usually one time unit
per instruction executed.  Simulated events (such as completion of I/O)
are scheduled at some number of time units in the future.  The simulator
executes synchronously, invoking event processors when simulated events
are scheduled to occur.  Even asynchronous events, like keyboard input,
are handled by polling at synchronous intervals.  The SHOW QUEUE command
displays the simulator event queue.

3. Commands

Simulator commands consist of a command verb, optional switches, and
optional arguments.  Switches take the form:

	-<letter>{<letter>...}

Multiple switches may be specified separately or together: -abcd or
-a -b -c -d are treated identically.  Verbs, switches, and other
input (except for file names) are case insensitive.

Any command beginning with semicolon (;) is considered a comment and
ignored.

3.1 Loading and Saving Programs

The LOAD command (abbreviation LO) loads a file in binary paper-tape
loader format:

	sim> load <filename> {implementation options}(cr)

The types of formats supported are implementation specific.  Options
(such as load within range) are also implementation specific.

The DUMP command (abbreviation DU) dumps memory in binary paper-
tape loader format:

	sim> dump <filename> {implementation options}(cr)

The types of formats supported are implementation specific.  Options
(such as dump within range) are also implementation specific.

3.2 Saving and Restoring State

The SAVE command (abbreviation SA) save the complete state of the
simulator to a file.  This includes the contents of main memory and
all registers, and the I/O connections of devices except network
devices (such as Ethernet controllers and terminal multiplexors):

	sim> save <filename>(cr)

The RESTORE command (abbreviation REST, alternately GET) restores a
previously saved simulator state:

	sim> restore <filename>(cr)

Note: SAVE file format compresses zeroes to minimize file size.

3.3 Resetting Devices

The RESET command (abbreviation RE) resets a device or the entire
simulator to a predefined condition.  If switch -p is specified,
the device is reset to its power-up state:

	sim> RESET(cr)			-- reset all devices
	sim> RESET -p(cr)		-- powerup all devices
	sim> RESET ALL(cr)		-- reset all devices
	sim> RESET <device>(cr)		-- reset specified device

Typically, RESET stops any in-progress I/O operation, clears any
interrupt request, and returns the device to a quiescent state.  It
does not clear main memory or affect I/O connections.

3.4 Connecting and Disconnecting Devices

Except for main memory and network devices, units are simulated as
unstructured binary disk files in the host file system.  Before
using a simulated unit, the user must specify the file to be accessed
by that unit.  The ATTACH (abbreviation AT) command associates a unit
and a file:

	sim> ATTACH <unit> <filename>(cr)

If the file does not exist, and the -e switch was not specified, a
new file is created, and an appropriate message is printed.  If the
-e switch was specified, a new file is not created, and an error
message is printed.

If the -r switch is specified, or the file is write protected, ATTACH
tries to open the file read only.  If the file does not exist, or the
unit does not support read only operation, an error occurs.  Input-
only devices, such as paper-tape readers, and devices with write lock
switches, such as disks and tapes, support read only operation; other
devices do not.  If a file is ATTACHed read only, its contents can be
examined but not modified. 

For simulated magnetic tapes, the ATTACH command can specify the
format of the attached tape image file:

	sim> ATTACH -f <tape_unit> <format> <filename>(cr)

The currently supported tape image file formats are:

	SIMH		SIMH simulator format
	E11		E11 simulator format
	TPC		TPC format

The tape format can also be set with the SET command prior to ATTACH:

	sim> SET <tape_unit> FORMAT=<format>(cr)
	sim> ATT <tape_unit> <filename>(cr)

The format of an attached file can be displayed with the SHOW command:

	sim> SHOW <tape_unit> FORMAT(cr)

For Telnet-based terminal emulators, the ATTACH command associates the
master unit with a TCP/IP port:

	sim> ATTACH <unit> <port>(cr)

The port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 and should not used
by standard TCP/IP protocols.

For Ethernet emulators, the ATTACH command associates the simulated
Ethernet with a physical Ethernet device:

	sim> ATTACH <unit> <physical device name>(cr)

The DETACH (abbreviation DET) command breaks the association between
a unit and a file, port, or network device:

	sim> DETACH ALL(cr)		-- detach all units
	sim> DETACH <unit>(cr)		-- detach specified unit

The EXIT command performs an automatic DETACH ALL.

3.5 Examining and Changing State

There are four commands to examine and change state:

	EXAMINE (abbreviated E) examines state
	DEPOSIT (abbreviated D) changes state
	IEXAMINE (interactive examine, abbreviated IE) examines state
		and allows the user to interactively change it
	IDEPOSIT (interactive deposit, abbreviated ID) allows the user
		to interactively change state

All four commands take the form

	command {modifiers} <state list>

Deposit must also include a deposit value at the end of the command.

There are four kinds of modifiers: switches, device/unit name, search
specifiers, and for EXAMINE, output file.  Switches have been described
previously.  A device/unit name identifies the device and unit whose
address space is to be examined or modified.  If no device is specified,
the CPU (main memory)is selected; if a device but no unit is specified,
unit 0 of the device is selected.

Search specifiers provide criteria for testing addresses or registers
to see if they should be processed.  A specifier consists of a logical
operator, a relational operator, or both, optionally separated by spaces.

	{<logical op> <value>} <relational op> <value>

where the logical operator is & (and), | (or), or ^ (xor), and the
relational operator is = or == (equal), ! or != (not equal), >=
(greater than or equal), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal), or
< (less than).  If a logical operator is specified without a relational
operator, it is ignored.  If a relational operator is specified without
a logical operator, no logical operation is performed.  All comparisons
are unsigned.

The output file modifier redirects command output to a file instead of
the console.  An output file modifier consists of @ followed by a
valid file name.

Modifiers may be specified in any order.  If multiple modifiers of the
same type are specified, later modifiers override earlier modifiers.
Note that if the device/unit name comes after the search specifier,
the values will interpreted in the radix of the CPU, rather than of the
device/unit.

The "state list" consists of one or more of the following, separated
by commas:

	register		the specified register
	register[sub1-sub2]	the specified register array locations,
				starting at location sub1 up to and
				including location sub2
	register[sub1/length]	the specified register array locations,
				starting at location sub1 up to but
				not including sub1+length
	register[ALL]		all locations in the specified register
				array
	register1-register2	all the registers starting at register1
				up to and including register2
	address			the specified location
	address1-address2	all locations starting at address1 up to
				and including address2
	address/length		all location starting at address up to
				but not including address+length
	STATE			all registers in the device
	ALL			all locations in the unit

Switches can be used to control the format of display information:

	-a			display as ASCII
	-c			display as character string
	-m			display as instruction mnemonics
	-o			display as octal
	-d			display as decimal
	-h			display as hexidecimal

The simulators typically accept symbolic input (see documentation with
each simulator).

Examples:

	sim> ex 1000-1100	-- examine 1100:1100
	sim> de PC 1040		-- set PC to 1040
	sim> ie 40-50		-- interactively examine 40:50
	sim> ie >1000 40-50	-- interactively examine the subset
				   of locations 40:50 that are >1000
	sim> ex rx0 50060	-- examine 50060, RX unit 0
	sim> ex rx sbuf[3-6]	-- examine SBUF[3] to SBUF[6] in RX
	sim> de all 0		-- set main memory to 0
	sim> de &77>0 0		-- set all addresses whose low order
				   bits are non-zero to 0
	sim> ex -m @memdump.txt 0-7777	-- dump memory to file

Note: to terminate an interactive command, simply type a bad value (eg,
XYZ) when input is requested.

3.6 Evaluating Instructions

The EVAL command evaluates a symbolic instruction and returns the
equivalent numeric value.  This is useful for obtaining numeric arguments
for a search command:

	sim> EVAL <expression>

3.7 Running Programs

The RUN command (abbreviated RU) resets all devices, deposits its argument
(if given) in the PC, and starts execution.  If no argument is given,
execution starts at the current PC.

The GO command does NOT reset devices, deposits its argument (if given)
in the PC, and starts execution.  If no argument is given, execution
starts at the current PC.

The CONT command (abbreviated CO) does NOT reset devices and resumes
execution at the current PC.

The STEP command (abbreviated S) resumes execution at the current PC
for the number of instructions given by its argument.  If no argument
is supplied, one instruction is executed.

The BOOT command (abbreviated BO) bootstraps the device and unit given
by its argument.  If no unit is supplied, unit 0 is bootstrapped.  The
specified unit must be attached.

3.8 Stopping Programs

Programs run until the simulator detects an error or stop condition, or
until the user forces a stop condition.

3.8.1 Simulator Detected Stop Conditions

These simulator-detected conditions stop simulation:

	- HALT instruction.  If a HALT instruction is decoded,
	  simulation stops.

	- Breakpoint.  The simulator may support breakpoints (see
	  below).

	- I/O error.  If an I/O error occurs during simulation of an
	  I/O operation, and the device stop-on-I/O-error flag is set,
	  simulation usually stops.

	- Processor condition.  Certain processor conditions can stop
	  simulation; these are described with the individual simulators.

3.8.2 User Specified Stop Conditions

Typing the interrupt character stops simulation.  The interrupt character
is defined by the WRU (where are you) console option and is initially set
to 005 (^E).

3.8.3 Breakpoints

A simulator may offer breakpoint capability.  A simulator may define
breakpoints of different types, identified by letter (for example, E
for execution, R for read, W for write, etc).  At the moment, most
simulators support only E (execution) breakpoints.

Associated with a breakpoint is a count and, optionally, one or more
actions.  Each time the breakpoint is taken, the associated count is
decremented.  If the count is less than or equal to 0, the breakpoint
occurs; otherwise, it is deferred.  When the breakpoint occurs, the
optional actions are automatically executed.

A breakpoint is set by the BREAK command:

	sim> BREAK {-types} <addr range>{[count]},{addr range...}
	     {;action;action...}

If no type is specified, the simulator-specific default breakpoint
type (usually E for execution) is used.  As with EXAMINE and DEPOSIT,
an address range may be a single address, a range of addresses low-high,
or a relative range of address/length.  Examples of BREAK:

	sim> break -e 200		-- set E break at 200
	sim> break 2000/2[2]		-- set E breaks at 2000,2001
					   with count = 2
	sim> break 100;ex ac;d mq 0	-- set E break at 100 with
					   actions EX AC and D MQ 0
	sim> break 100;			-- delete action on break at 100

Currently set breakpoints can be displayed with the SHOW BREAK command:

	sim> SHOW {-types} BREAK {ALL|<addr range>{,<addr range>...}}

Locations with breakpoints of the specified type are displayed.

Finally, breakpoints can be cleared by the NOBREAK command.

3.9 Setting Device Parameters

The SET command (abbreviated SE) changes the status of one or more device
parameters:

	sim> SET <device> <parameter>{=<value},{<parameter>{=<value>},...}

or one or more unit parameters:

	sim> SET <unit> <parameter>{=<value>},{<parameter>{=<value>},...}

Most parameters are simulator and device specific.  Disk drives, for
example, can usually be set WRITEENABLED or write LOCKED; if a device
supports multiple drive types, the SET command can be used to specify
the drive type.

All devices recognize the following parameters:

	OCT		sets the data radix = 8
	DEC		sets the data radix = 10
	HEX		sets the data radix = 16

3.10 Displaying Parameters and Status

The SHOW command (abbreviated SH) displays the status of one or more device
parameters:

	sim> SHOW {<modifiers} <device> <parameter>{=<value>},
		{<parameter>{=<value>},...}

or one or more unit parameters:

	sim> SHOW {<modifiers} <unit> <parameter>{=<value>},
		{<parameter>{=<value>},...}

There are two kinds of modifiers: switches and output file.  Switches have
been described previously.  The output file modifier redirects command output
to a file instead of the console.  An output file modifier consists of @
followed by a valid file name.

All devices implement parameters RADIX (the display radix), MODIFIERS
(list of valid modifiers), and NAMES (logical name).  Other device and
unit parameters are implementation-specific.

SHOW is also used to display global simulation state:
 
- SHOW CONFIGURATION shows the simulator configuration and the status
  of all simulated devices and units.
- SHOW DEVICES shows the configuration of all simulated devices.
- SHOW MODIFIERS shows the modifiers available on all simulated devices.
- SHOW QUEUE shows the state of the simulator event queue.  Times are
  in "simulation units", typically one unit per instruction execution,
  relative to the current simulation time.
- SHOW TIME shows the number of time units elapsed since the last RUN
  command.
- SHOW <device> shows the status of the named simulated device.
- SHOW <unit> shows the status of the named simulated unit.

3.11 Altering The Simulated Configuration

In most simulators, the SET <device> DISABLED command removes the
specified device from the configuration.  A DISABLED device is
invisible to running programs.  The device can still be RESET but
it cannot be ATTAChed, DETACHed, or BOOTed.  SET <device> ENABLED
restores a disabled device to a configuration.

Most multi-unit devices allow units to be enabled or disabled:

	sim> SET <unit> ENABLED
	sim> SET <unit> DISABLED

When a unit is disabled, it will not be displayed by SHOW DEVICE.

The standard device names can be supplemented with logical names.
Logical names must be unique within a simulator (that is, they cannot
be the same as an existing device name).  To assign a logical name
to a device:

	sim> ASSIGN <device> <log-name>	-- assign log-name to device

To remove a logical name:

	sim> DEASSIGN <device>		-- remove logical name

To show the current logical name assignment:

	sim> SHOW <device> NAMES	-- show logical name, if any

To show all logical names:

	sim> SHOW NAMES

3.12 Console Options

Console options are controlled by the SET CONSOLE command.

The console terminal normally runs in the controlling window.
Optionally,  the console terminal can be connected to a Telnet port.
This allows systems to emulate a VT100 using the built-in terminal
emulation of the Telnet client.

	sim> SET CONSOLE TELNET=<port>	-- connect console terminal
					   to Telnet session on port
	sim> SET CONSOLE NOTELNET	-- disable console Telnet

Output to the console can be logged simultaneously to a file:

	sim> SET CONSOLE LOG=<filename>	-- log console output to file
	sim> SET CONSOLE NOLOG		-- disable logging

The console provides a limited key remapping capability:

	sim> SET CONSOLE WRU=<value>	-- interpret ASCII code
					   value as WRU
	sim> SET CONSOLE BRK=<value>	-- interpret ASCII code
					   value as BREAK (0 disables)
	sim> SET CONSOLE DEL=<value>	-- interpret ASCII code
					   value as DELETE

Values are hexadecimal on hex CPU's, octal on all others.

The SHOW CONSOLE command displays the current state of console options:

	sim> SHOW CONSOLE		-- show all console options
	sim> SHOW CONSOLE TELNET	-- show console Telnet state
	sim> SHOW CONSOLE LOG		-- show console logging state
	sim> SHOW CONSOLE WRU		-- show value assigned to WRU
	sim> SHOW CONSOLE BRK		-- show value assigned to BREAK
	sim> SHOW CONSOLE DEL		-- show value assigned to DELETE

Both SET CONSOLE and SHOW CONSOLE accept multiple parameters, separated by
commas, e.g.,

	SIM> SET CONSOLE WRU=5,DEL=177	-- set code values for WRU and DEL

3.13 Executing Command Files

The simulator can execute command files with the DO command:

	sim> DO <filename> {arguments...}	-- execute commands in file

The DO command allows command files to contain substitutable arguments.
The string %n is recognized as meaning argument n from the DO command
line. The character \ has the usual UNIX meaning of an escape character;
the next character is interpreted literally, even if it is % or \.
Arguments with spaces can be enclosed in matching single or double
quotation marks.

If the switch -V is specified, the commands in the file are echoed before
they are executed.  DO commands may be nested up to ten invocations deep.

Several commands are particularly useful within command files.  While they
may be executed interactively, they have only limited functionality when so
used.

3.13.1 Displaying Arbitrary Text
 
The ECHO command is a useful way of annotating command files.  ECHO
prints out its argument on the console:
 
	sim> ECHO <string>		-- output string to console
 
If there is no argument, ECHO prints a blank line on the console.  This may
be used to provide spacing in the console display or log.

3.13.2 Testing Simulator State

The ASSERT command tests a simulator state condition and halts command file
execution if the condition is false:

	sim> ASSERT {<dev>} <reg>{<logical-op><value>}<conditional-op><value>

If <dev> is not specified, CPU is assumed.  <reg> is a register (scalar or
subscripted) belonging to the indicated device.  The <conditional-op> and
optional <logical-op> are the same as those used for "search specifiers" by
the EXAMINE and DEPOSIT commands (see above).  The <value>s are expressed in
the radix specified for <reg>, not in the radix for the device.

If the <logical-op> and <value> are specified, the target register value is
first altered as indicated.  The result is then compared to the <value> via
the <conditional-op>.  If the result is false, an "Assertion failed" message
is printed, and any running command file is aborted.  Otherwise, the command
has no effect.

For example, a command file might be used to bootstrap an operating system
that halts after the initial load from disk.  The ASSERT command is then
used to confirm that the load completed successfully by examining the CPU's
"A" register for the expected value:

	; OS bootstrap command file
	;
	ATTACH DS0 os.disk
	BOOT DS
	; A register contains error code; 0 = good boot
	ASSERT A=0
	ATTACH MT0 sys.tape
	ATTACH MT1 user.tape
	RUN

In the example, if the A register is not 0, the command file will be aborted
with an "Assertion failed (A=0)" message.  Otherwise, the command file will
continue to bring up the operating system.

3.14 Executing System Commands

The simulator can execute operating system commands with the ! (spawn)
command:

	sim> ! <host operating system command>

If no operating system command is provided, the simulator attempts to
launch the host operating system's command shell.

3.15 Getting Help

The HELP command prints out information about a command or about all
commands:

	sim> HELP			-- print all HELP messages
	sim> HELP <command>		-- print HELP for command

3.16 Controlling Debugging

Some simulated devices may provide debug printouts to help in diagnosing
complicated problems.  Debug output may be sent to a variety of places,
or disabled entirely:

	sim> SET CONSOLE DEBUG=STDOUT	  -- direct debug output to stdout
	sim> SET CONSOLE DEBUG=STDERR	  -- direct debug output to stderr
	sim> SET CONSOLE DEBUG=LOG	  -- direct debug output to log file
	sim> SET CONSOLE DEBUG=<filename> -- direct debug output to file
	sim> SET CONSOLE NODEBUG	  -- disable debug output

If debug output is enabled, individual devices can be controlled with the
SET command.  If a device has only a single debug flag:

	sim> SET <device> DEBUG		  -- enable device debug output
	sim> SET <device> NODEBUG	  -- disable device debug output

If the device has individual, named debug flags:

	sim> SET <device> DEBUG		    -- enable all device debug flags
	sim> SET <device> DEBUG=n1;n2;...   -- enable device debug flags n1, n2, ...
	sim> SET <device> NODEBUG=n1;n2;... -- disable device debug flags n1, n2, ...
	sim> SET <device> NODEBUG	    -- disable all device debug flags

If debug output is directed to stdout, it will be intermixed with normal
simulator output.

3.17 Exiting The Simulator

EXIT (synonyms QUIT and BYE) returns control to the operating system.

Appendix 1: File Representations

All file representations are little endian.  On big endian hosts, the
simulator automatically performs any required byte swapping.

1. Hard Disks

Hard disks are represented as unstructured binary files of 16b data
items for the 12b and 16b simulators, of 32b data items for the 18b,
24b, and 32b simulators, and 64b for the 36b simulators.

2. Floppy Disks

PDP-8 and PDP-11 floppy disks are represented as unstructured binary
files of 8b data items.  They are nearly identical to the floppy disk
images for Doug Jones' PDP-8 simulator but lack the initial 256 byte
header.  A utility for converting between the two formats is easily
written.

3. Magnetic Tapes

Magnetic tapes are represented as unstructured binary files of 8b data
items.  Each record starts with a 32b record header, in little endian
format.  If the record header is not a special header, it is followed
by n 8b bytes of data, followed by a repeat of the 32b record header.
A 1 in the high order bit of the record header indicates an error in
the record. If the byte count is odd, the record is padded to even
length; the pad byte is undefined.

Special record headers occur only once and have no data.  The currently
defined special headers are:

	0x00000000		file mark
	0xFFFFFFFF		end of medium

Magnetic tapes are endian independent and consistent across simulator
families.  A magtape produced by the Nova simulator will appear to
have its 16b words byte swapped if read by the PDP-11 simulator.

SIMH can read and write E11-format magtape images.  E11 format differs
from SIMH format only for odd-length records; the data portion of E11
records is not padded with an extra byte.

SIMH can read TPC-format magtape images.  TPC format uses a 16b record
header, with 0x0000 denoting file mark.  The record header is not
repeated at the end of the record.  Odd-length records are padded with
an extra byte.

4. Line Printers

Line printer output is represented by an ASCII file of lines separated
by the newline character.  Overprinting is represented by a line ending
in return rather than newline.

5. DECtapes

DECtapes are structured as fixed length blocks.  PDP-1/4/7/9/15 DECtapes
use 578 blocks of 256 32b words.  Each 32b word contains 18b (6 lines)
of data.  PDP-11 DECtapes use 578 blocks of 256 16b words.  Each 16b word
contains 6 lines of data, with 2b omitted.  This is compatible with native
PDP-11 DECtape dump facilities, and with John Wilson's PUTR Program.  PDP-8
DECtapes use 1474 blocks of 129 16b words.  Each 16b word contains 12b
(4 lines) of data.  PDP-8 OS/8 does not use the 129th word of each block,
and OS/8 DECtape dumps contain only 128 words per block.  A utility,
DTOS8CVT.C, is provided to convert OS/8 DECtape dumps to simulator format.

A known issue in DECtape format is that when a block is recorded in
one direction and read in the other, the bits in a word are scrambled
(to the complement obverse).  The PDP-11 deals with this problem by
performing an automatic complement obverse on reverse writes and reads.
The other systems leave this problem to software.

The simulator represents this difference as follows.  On the PDP-11, all
data is represented in normal form.  Data reads and writes are not direction
sensitive;  read all and write all are direction sensitive.  Real DECtapes
that are read forward will generate images with the correct representation
of the data.

On the other systems, forward write creates data in normal form, while
reverse write creates data in complement obverse form.  Forward read (and
read all) performs no transformations, while reverse read (and read all)
changes data to the complement obverse.  Real DECtapes that are read forward
will generate data in normal form for blocks written forward, and complement
obverse data for blocks written in reverse, corresponding to the simulator
format.
