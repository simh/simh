                           **********
                           Halt Guide
                           **********

This following list is my own reformatting and rewording of the
official IBM Halt Guide for the Model 8/10 SCP.

The halts are those displayed on the message display unit.  The
list is in alphabetical order for easy reference.

When the system halts, the two 7-segment displays will display the
halt as listed here, and the system console (or printer if the log
device is the printer) will print the "SCP Message" below.  To
respond to the halt, deposit one of the valid response numbers
(0 thru 3) into the SR, and then use the C command to continue.

Unless otherwise stated, a response of 0 means to continue and accept
the error, 1 means to retry the operation or re-read the statement in
error, 2 means to cancel the job and retain added records (if any) and
3 means to end the job and discard any added records in files.

This is a listing of those halts likely to be encountered using SCP on
the simuator,   it is not the complete list of all possible halts.
