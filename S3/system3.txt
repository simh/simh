					requests to trace.log.
				0x80: Breakpoint on first character
					written to 5471 printer.

1	5471 Printer/Keyboard

	This is the operator console.  It has the following registers:

	FLAG	5471 Flag Bytes
	IBUF:	Input character from keyboard
	OBUF:	Output character to printer
	POS:	Number of characters printed
	TIME:	Delay for device operation
	REQKEY:	ASCII value of key mapped to 5471 REQUEST key
	RTNKEY:	ASCII value of key mapped to 5471 RETURN key
	ENDKEY:	ASCII value of key mapped to 5471 END key
	CANKEY:	ASCII value of key mapped to 5471 CANCEL key
	

2	1442 Card Reader.  This reader reads 80-column cards; the input
	is usually an ASCII file which is translated to EBCDIC when read,
	but optionally can be a binary file in EBCDIC format (such as an
	object program).

	LAST	Last card switch
	ERR	Card Reader Error
	NOTRDY	1442 reader not ready (not attached or past EOF)
	DAR	Data Address Register (shared with punch)
	LCR	Length Count Register (shared with punch)
	EBCDIC	EBCDIC mode flag: if 1, input is 80-col EBCDIC binary.
		(IPL from 1442 automatically sets this to 1).
	S2	Stacker 2 is selected when this is 1
	POS	Number of cards read
	TIME	Device Delay

	The real hardware 1442 had only 1 hopper for cards, whether
	these were used for blank cards for punching, or cards to be
	read.  Cards could be read without a feed cycle, then
	punched.  When punching cards, the SCP does a read of a card,
	makes sure it is blank, and then punches it.  To simulate
	this without requiring that a stack of blank lines be attached
	to the card reader device, a special feature of the simulator
	is this:  if no file is attached to the cdr device, but a file
	is attached to the cdp or the cdp2 devices, any read from the
	reader will return a blank card -- i.e. when punching, an
	unattached cdr device is assumed to be loaded with an unlimited
	supply of blank cards.


3	1442 Card Punch.  Normally cards are written to the attached
	disk file as ASCII with newline/cr delimiters.  But an optional
	flag allows writing as 80-column binary EBCDIC.

	ERR	Card Punch Error
	EBCDIC	When this is 1, output will be 80-col EBCDIC.
	S2	When this is 1, output is placed in stacker 2
	NOTRDY	1442 punch not ready (not attached)
	DAR	Data Address Register (shared with reader)
	LCR	Length Count Register (shared with reader)
	POS	Number of cards punched
	TIME	Device Delay

4 	1442 Stacker 2.  When cards are to be punched in stacker 2,
	attach a disk file to this device (cdp2) to hold that output.
	Note: When SCP punches cards, the default is to punch in
	stacker 2.

	POS0	Number of cards punched.

5	1403 Printer.  This is a 132-column output device, emulating
	the famous IBM 1403, models 2, 6, and N1.  Output is always
	translated to ASCII with newline/CR delimiters.  Page advance
	is output as a form feed.

	ERR	1403 error flags
	LPDAR	Data Address Register
	LPFLR	Forms Length Register
	LPIAR	Image Address Register
	LINECT	Current Line on form
	POS	Number of lines printed

6 	5444 Disk Drives (R1, R2, F1, F2)

	The 5444 came as a set of two drives, each with two disks.  The
	top disk in a drive was removable, the bottom fixed.  The first
	drive consists of disks R1 and F1, the second drive R2 and F2.
	Each disk holds 2,467,600 bytes of user data, plus 3 alternate
	tracks and a CE track.  Flagging of alternate tracks is not
	supported in this version of the simulator.

	NOTRDY	Drive not ready (not attached)
	SEEK	Drive is busy with a seek operation
	DAR	Data Address Register
	CAR	Control Address Register
	ERR	Error Flags (16 bits)
	CYL	Current Cylinder (0 thru 203)
	HEAD	Current head (0 or 1)
	POS	Current position in attached disk file
	TIME	Device Delay

7  	Symbolic Display and Input

	The System/3 Simulator supports symbolic display and input.
	Display is controlled by command line switches:

	(none)	display as hex EBCDIC
	-c	display bytes as characters
	-m	display instruction mnemonics.
	-a	display a 256-byte block of memory in both hex and ASCII.

   	The symbolic  format contains the same elements as the machine
	language operation, but not always in the same order.  The
	operation code frequently specifies both the opcode and the Q byte,
	and the top nybble of the opcode is determined by the format of the
	addresses.

	Addresses take two forms:  the direct address in hex, or a relative
	address specified thusly: (byte,XRx) where 'byte' is a 1-byte
	offset, and XRx is either XR1 or XR2 for the two index registers. 
	Use these formats when 'address' is indicated below:

   	When 'reg' is mentioned, a mnemonic may be used for the register,
   	thusly:
	
	IAR	Instruction Address Register for the current program level
	ARR	Address Recall Register for the current program level
	P1IAR	IAR for Program Level 1
	P2IAR	IAR for Program Level 2
	PSR	Program Status Register
	XR1	Index Register 1
	XR2 	Index Register 2
	IARx	IAR for the interrupt level x (x = 0 thru 7)
	   
   	All other operands mentioned below are single-byte hex, except for
	the length (len) operand of the two-address instructions, which is a
	decimal length in the range 1-256.

        In operations where there is a source and a destination, the 
	destination is always operand 1, the source is operand 2.
   
   	No-address formats:
   	------------------
   
   	HPL hex,hex		Halt Program Level, the operands are the
				Q and R bytes.
   
   
   	One-address formats:
  	-------------------
   
	A reg,address        	Add to register
   	CLI address,byte	Compare Logical Immediate
   	MVI address,byte	Move Immediate
   	TBF address,mask	Test Bits Off
   	TBN address,mask	Test Bits On
  	SBF address,mask	Set Bits Off
   	SBN address,mask	Set Bits On
   	ST reg,address		Store Register
   	L reg,address		Load Register
   	LA reg,address		Load Address (reg can only be XR1 or XR2)
   	JC address,cond		Jump on Condition
   	BC address,cond		Branch on Condition
   
   	These operations do not specify a qbyte, it is implicit in the
   	opcode:
   
   	B address		Unconditional branch to address
   	BE address		Branch Equal
   	BNE address		Branch Not Equal
   	BH address		Branch High
   	BNH address		Branch Not High
   	BL address		Branch Low
   	BNL address		Branch Not Low
   	BT address		Branch True
   	BF address		Branch False
   	BP address		Branch Plus
   	BM address		Branch Minus
   	BNP address		Branch Not Plus
   	BNM address		Branch Not Minus
   	BZ address		Branch Zero
   	BNZ address		Branch Not Zero
   	BOZ address		Branch Overflow Zoned
   	BOL address		Branch Overflow Logical
   	BNOZ address		Branch No Overflow Zoned
   	BNOL address		Branch No Overflow Logical
   	NOPB address		No - never branch
   
   	(substitute J for B above for a set of Jumps -- 1-byte operand (not
    	2), always jumps forward up to 255 bytes from the address following
    	the Jump instruction. In this case, 'address' cannot be less than
    	the current address, nor greater than the current address + 255)
   
   	Two-address formats (first address is destination, len is decimal 1-256):
   	-------------------
   
   	MVC address,address,len		Move Characters
   	CLC address,address,len		Compare Logical Characters
   	ALC address,address,len		Add Logical Characters
   	SLC address,address,len		Subtract Logical Characters
   	ED address,address,len		Edit
   	ITC address,address,len		Insert and Test Characters
   	AZ address,address,len		Add Zoned Decimal
   	SZ address,address,len		Subtract Zoned Decimal
   
   	MNN address,address		Move Numeric to Numeric
   	MNZ address,address		Move Numeric to Zone
   	MZZ address,address		Move Zone to Zone
   	MZN address,address		Move Zone to Numeric
   
   	I/O Format
  	----------
   
   	In the I/O format, there are always 3 fields:
   
   	da - Device Address 0-15 (decimal)
   	m - Modifier 0-1
   	n - Function 0-7
   	
   	The meaning of these is entirely defined by the device addressed.	
   	
   	There may be an optional control byte, or an optional address (based
	on the type of instruction).

	SNS da,m,n,address		Sense I/O
	LIO da,m,n,address		Load I/O
	TIO da,m,n,address		Test I/O
	
	SIO da,m,n,cc			Start I/O -- cc is a control byte
	
	APL da,m,n			Advance Program Level 


8	Device Programming.

	Note: On a model 15, interrupts are used for all devices.  On
	other models, interrupts are only used for the printer/keyboard.

	This is a summary of the DA, M, N, and CC codes for all supported
	devices:
