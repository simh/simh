   simulator.  It is required by all modules.


   -----------------------------------------------------
   Implementation Note -- Compiling the Simulator as C++
   -----------------------------------------------------

   Although simulators are written in C, the SIMH project encourages developers
   to compile them with a C++ compiler to obtain the more careful type checking
   provided.  To obtain successful compilations, the simulator must be written
   in the subset of C that is also valid C++.  Using valid C features beyond
   that subset, as the HP 2100 simulator does, will produce C++ compiler errors.

   The standard C features used by the simulator that prevent error-free C++
   compilation are:

    1. Incomplete types.

       In C, mutually recursive type definitions are allowed by the use of
       incomplete type declarations, such as "DEVICE ms_dev;" followed later by
       "DEVICE ms_dev {...};".  Several HP device simulators use this feature to
       place a pointer to the device structure in the "desc" field of an MTAB
       array element, typically when the associated validation or display
       routine handles multiple devices.  As the DEVICE contains a pointer to
       the MTAB array, and an MTAB array element contains a pointer to the
       DEVICE, the definitions are mutually recursive, and incomplete types are
       employed.  C++ does not permit incomplete types.

    2. Implicit conversion of ints to enums.

       In C, enumeration types are compatible with integer types, and its
       members are constants having type "int".  As such, they are semantically
       equivalent to and may be used interchangeably with integers.  For the
       developer, though, C enumerations have some advantages.  In particular,
       the compiler may check a "switch" statement to ensure that all of the
       enumeration cases are covered.  Also, a mathematical set may be modeled
       by an enumeration type with disjoint enumerator values, with the bitwise
       integer OR and AND operators modeling the set union and intersection
       operations.  The latter has direct support in the "gdb" debugger, which
       will display an enumerated type value as a union of the various
       enumerators.  The HP simulator makes extensive use of both features to
       model hardware signal buses (e.g., INBOUND_SET, OUTBOUND_SET) and so
       performs bitwise integer operations on the enumerations to model signal
       assertion and denial.  In C++, implicit conversion from enumerations to
       integers is allowed, but conversion from integers to enumerations is
       illegal without explicit casts.  Therefore, the idiom employed by the
       simulator to assert a signal (e.g., "outbound_signals |= INTREQ") is
       rejected by the C++ compiler.

    3. Implicit increment operations on enums.

       Because enums are compatible with integers in C, no special enumerator
       increment operator is provided.  To cycle through the range of an
       enumeration type, e.g. in a "for" statement, the standard integer
       increment operator, "++", is used.  In C++, the "++" operator must be
       overloaded with a version specific to the enumeration type; applying the
       integer "++" to an enumeration is illegal.

    4. Use of C++ keywords as variable names.

       C++ reserves a number of additional keywords beyond those reserved by C.
       Use of any of these keywords as a variable or type name is legal C but
       illegal C++.  The HP simulator uses variables named "class" and
       "operator", which are keywords in C++.

   The HP simulator is written in ISO standard C and will compile cleanly with a
   compiler implementing the 1999 C standard.  Compilation as C++ is not a goal
   of the simulator and cannot work, given the incompatibilities listed above.

/* The following pragmas quell clang and Microsoft Visual C++ warnings that are

   symbols that, in my view, make the code harder to read and maintain, I elect

/* Tracing and console output.

   "tprintf" is used to write tracing messages.  It does an "fprintf" to the
   debug output stream if the stream is open and the trace "flag" is currently
   enabled in device "dev".  Otherwise, it's a NOP.  "..." is the format string
   and associated values.

   "tpprintf" is identical to "tprintf", except that a device pointer is passed
   instead of a device structure.

   "TRACING" and "TRACINGP" implement the test conditions for device and device
   pointer tracing, respectively.  They are used explicitly only when several
   trace statements employing the same flag are required, and it is desirable to
   avoid repeating the stream and flag test for each one.

   "cprintf", "cputs", and "cputc" are used to write messages to the console
   and, if console logging is enabled, to the log output stream.  They do
   "(f)printf", "fputs", or "(f)putc", respectively.  "..." is the format string
   and associated values, "str" is the string to write, and "ch" is the
   character to write.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The "cputs" macro uses "fputs" for both console and log file output
       because "puts" appends a newline, whereas "fputs" does not.

/* I/O event timing.

   I/O events are scheduled for future service by specifying the desired delay
   in units of event ticks.  Typically, one event tick represents the execution
   of one CPU instruction, and this is the way event ticks are defined in the
   current simulator implementation.  However, the various CPUs themselves not
   only vary in speed, but the actual instruction times vary greatly, due to the
   presence of block move, compare, and scan instructions.  Variations of an
   order of magnitude are common, and two orders or more are possible for longer
   blocks.

   The 24296-90001 Diagnostic Configurator provides a one millisecond timer for
   use by the diagnostic programs.  The timer is a two-instruction software
   loop, plus four instructions of entry/exit overhead, based on the processor
   type.  The values provided are:

             Loop     Instr
     CPU     Count    /msec
     ------  -----    -----
     2114      246      496
     2115      246      496
     2116      309      622
     2100      252      508
     1000-M    203      410
     1000-E   1573 *   1577

     * The E-Series TIMER instruction is used instead of a software loop.  TIMER
       re-executes an internal decrement until the supplied value reaches zero.

   To pass diagnostics that time peripheral operations, the simulator assumes
   the E-Series execution rate for all devices (0.634 microseconds per event
   tick), although this results in needlessly long delays for normal operation.
   A correct implementation would change the timing base depending on the
   currently selected CPU.

   To accommodate possible future variable instruction timing, I/O service
   activation times must not assume a constant 0.634 microseconds per event
   tick.  Delays should be defined in terms of the "uS" (microseconds), "mS"
   (milliseconds), and "S" (seconds) macros below.

/* Architectural constants.

   These macros specify the width, sign location, value mask, and minimum and
   maximum signed and unsigned values for the data sizes supported by the
   simulator.  In addition, masks for 16-bit and 32-bit overflow are defined (an
   overflow is indicated if the masked bits are not all ones or all zeros).

   The HP_WORD type is used to declare variables that represent 16-bit registers
   or buses in hardware.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The HP_WORD type is a 32-bit unsigned type, instead of the more logical
       16-bit unsigned type.  There are two reasons for this.  First, SCP
       requires that scalars referenced by REG (register) entries be 32 bits in
       size.  Second, IA-32 processors execute instructions with 32-bit operands
       much faster than those with 16-bit operands.

       Using 16-bit operands omits the masking required for 32-bit values.  For
       example, the code generated for the following operations is as follows:

         uint16 a, b, c;
         a = b + c & 0xFFFF;

            movzwl  _b, %eax
            addw    _c, %ax
            movw    %ax, _a

       However, the first case uses operand override prefixes, which require
       substantially more time to decode (6 clock cycles vs. 1 clock cycle).
       This time outweighs the additional 32-bit AND instruction, which executes
       in 1 clock cycle.

    2. The MEMORY_WORD type is a 16-bit unsigned type, corresponding with the
       16-bit main memory in the HP 21xx/1000.  Unlike the general data type,
       which is a 32-bit type for speed, main memory does not benefit from the
       faster 32-bit execution on IA-32 processors, as only one instruction in
       the mem_read and mem_write routines has an operand override that invokes
       the slower instruction fetch path.  There is a negligible difference in
       the Memory Pattern Test diagnostic execution speeds for the uint32 vs.
       uint16 definition, whereas the VM requirements are doubled for the
       former.

   Conversions that otherwise would make inherent size assumptions must instead
   be coded explicitly.  For example, doing:

   ...will not guarantee that the upper 16 bits of "negative_value_32" are all
   ones, whereas the supplied sign-extension macro will.

   The conversions available are:

     - SEXT8  -- signed 8-bit value sign-extended to int32
     - SEXT16 -- signed 16-bit value sign-extended to int32
     - NEG8   -- signed 8-bit value negated
     - NEG16  -- signed 16-bit value negated

     - INT16  -- uint16 to int16
     - INT32  -- uint32 to int32


   Implementation notes:

    1. The SEXTn and INTn routines assume that their values are masked to
       exactly n bits before invoking.

/* CPU instruction symbolic source.

   The memory-reference group (MRG) instructions do not specify full logical
   addresses of their targets.  Instead, they specify offsets from either the
   base page or the current page.  Instructions specifying base-page offsets are
   always displayed with target addresses between 0000-1777.  The display and
   parsing of instructions specifying current-page offsets depends on the source
   of the instructions.

   If the current-page CPU instruction is contained in main memory, the current
   page is taken from the address of the word containing the instruction, and
   the full target address between 00000-77777 is displayed or parsed.  However,
   if the instruction is contained in a device buffer, e.g., a disc drive sector
   buffer, the destination memory address is unknown until the instruction is
   transferred to memory.  In this case, the target address is displayed or
   parsed as the offset prefixed with the letter "C" (e.g., "LDA C 1200").  In
   order to present the proper symbolic behavior, the mnemonic formatter and
   parser must know the source of the request.

   Additionally, display requests from the EXAMINE command have preloaded a
   value array with the maximum number of words required to encode the longest
   instruction.  This is inefficient, as only a fraction of the instruction set
   requires more than one word.  For EXAMINE commands entered by the user at the
   SCP prompt, this is unimportant.  However, for calls from the CPU instruction
   trace routine, the overhead is significant.  In the latter case, the array is
   loaded only with a single word, and the mnemonic formatter loads additional
   words if the specific instruction to be displayed requires them.

/* I/O backplane signals.

   The IOSIGNAL declarations mirror the hardware I/O backplane signals.  A set
   of one or more signals forms an IOCYCLE that is sent to a device IOHANDLER
   for action.  The CPU and DMA dispatch one signal set to the target device
   handler per I/O cycle.  A CPU cycle consists of either one or two signals; if
   present, the second signal will be CLF.  A DMA cycle consists of from two to
   five signals.  In addition, a front-panel PRESET or power-on reset dispatches
   two or three signals, respectively.

   In hardware, signals are assigned to one or more specific I/O T-periods, and
   some signals are asserted concurrently.  For example, a programmed STC sc,C
   instruction asserts the STC and CLF signals together in period T4.  Under
   simulation, signals are ORed to form an I/O cycle; in this example, the
   signal handler would receive an IOCYCLE value of "ioSTC | ioCLF".

   Hardware allows parallel action for concurrent signals.  Under simulation, a
   "concurrent" set of signals is processed sequentially by the signal handler
   in order of ascending numerical value.  Although assigned T-periods differ
   between programmed I/O and DMA I/O cycles, a single processing order is used.
   The order of execution generally follows the order of T-period assertion,
   except that ioSIR is processed after all other signals that may affect the
   interrupt request chain.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The ioCLF signal must be processed after ioSFS/ioSFC to ensure that a
       true skip test generates ioSKF before the flag is cleared, and after
       ioIOI/ioIOO/ioSTC/ioCLC to meet the requirement that executing an
       instruction having the H/C bit set is equivalent to executing the same
       instruction with the H/C bit clear and then a CLF instruction.

    2. The ioSKF signal is never sent to an I/O handler.  Rather, it is returned
       from the handler if the SFC or SFS condition is true.  If the condition
       is false, ioNONE is returned instead.  As these two values are returned
       in the 16-bit data portion of the returned value, their assigned values
       must be <= 100000 octal.

    3. An I/O handler will receive ioCRS as a result of a CLC 0 instruction,
       ioPOPIO and ioCRS as a result of a RESET command, and ioPON, ioPOPIO, and
       ioCRS as a result of a RESET -P command.

    4. An I/O handler will receive ioNONE when a HLT instruction is executed
       that has the H/C bit clear (i.e., no CLF generated).

    5. In hardware, the SIR signal is generated unconditionally every T5 period
       to time the setting of the IRQ flip-flop.  Under simulation, ioSIR
       indicates that the I/O handler must set the PRL, IRQ, and SRQ signals as
       required by the interface logic.  ioSIR must be included in the I/O cycle
       if any of the flip-flops affecting these signals are changed and the
       interface supports interrupts or DMA transfers.

    6. In hardware, the ENF signal is unconditionally generated every T2 period
       to time the setting of the flag flip-flop and to reset the IRQ flip-flop.
       If the flag buffer flip-flip is set, then flag will be set by ENF.  If
       the flag buffer is clear, ENF will not affect flag.  Under simulation,
       ioENF is sent to set the flag buffer and flag flip-flops.  For those
       interfaces where this action is identical to that provided by STF, the
       ioENF handler may simply fall into the ioSTF handler.

    7. In hardware, the PON signal is asserted continuously while the CPU is
       operating.  Under simulation, ioPON is asserted only at simulator
       initialization or when processing a RESET -P command.

   The Device Information Block (DIB) allows devices to be relocated in the
   machine's I/O space.  Each DIB contains a pointer to the device interface
   routine, a value corresponding to the location of the interface card in the
   CPU's I/O card cage (which determines the card's select code), and a card
   index if the interface routine services multiple cards.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The select_code and card_index fields could be smaller than the defined
       32-bit sizes, but IA-32 processors execute instructions with 32-bit
       operands much faster than those with 16- or 8-bit operands.

    2. The DIB_REGS macro provides hidden register entries needed to save and
       restore the state of a DIB.  Only the potentially variable fields are
       referenced.  In particular, the "io_interface" field must not be saved,
       as the address of the device's interface routine may change from version
       to version of the simulator.

/* I/O signal and status macros.

   The following macros are useful in I/O signal handlers and unit service
   routines.  The parameter definition symbols employed are:

     I = an IOCYCLE value
     E = a t_stat error status value
     D = a uint16 data value
     C = a uint32 combined status and data value
     P = a pointer to a DIB structure
     B = a Boolean test value

   Implementation notes:

    1. The IONEXT macro isolates the next signal in sequence to process from the
       I/O cycle I.

    2. The IOADDSIR macro adds an ioSIR signal to the I/O cycle I if it
       contains signals that might change the interrupt state.

    3. The IORETURN macro forms the combined status and data value to be
       returned by a handler from the t_stat error code E and the 16-bit data
       value D.

    4. The IOSTATUS macro isolates the t_stat error code from a combined status
       and data value value C.

    5. The IODATA macro isolates the 16-bit data value from a combined status
       and data value value C.

    6. The IOPOWERON macro calls signal handler P->H with DIB pointer P to
       process a power-on reset action.

    7. The IOPRESET macro calls signal handler P->H with DIB pointer P to
       process a front-panel PRESET action.

    8. The IOERROR macro returns t_stat error code E from a unit service routine
       if the Boolean test B is true.

    2. The setPRL macro sets the Priority Low signal for select code S to the
       Boolean value B.

    3. The setIRQ macro sets the Interrupt Request signal for select code S to
       the Boolean value B.

    4. The setSRQ macro sets the Service Request signal for select code S to the

    6. The IRQ macro returns the Interrupt Request signal for select code S as a

    7. The SRQ macro returns the Service Request signal for select code S as a

    8. The setstdSKF macro sets Skip on Flag signal in the return data value if
       the flag state in structure N matches the current skip test condition.

       referenced by "dibptr" using the standard logic and the control and flag
       states in structure N.

       referenced by "dibptr" using the standard logic and the control, flag,
       and flag buffer states in structure N.

   11. The setstdSRQ macro sets the Service Request signal for the select code
