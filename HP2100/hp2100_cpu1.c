   This source file contains the Extended Arithmetic Unit simulator and the User
   Instruction Group (a.k.a. "Macro") dispatcher for the 2100 and 1000 (21MX)
   CPUs.  The UIG simulators reside in separate source files, due to the large
   number of firmware options available for these machines.  Unit flags indicate
   which options are present in the current system.

   This module also provides generalized instruction operand processing.

   The 2100 and 1000 machines were microprogrammable; the 2116/15/14 machines
   were not.  Both user- and HP-written microprograms were supported.  The
   microcode address space of the 2100 encompassed four modules of 256 words
   each.  The 1000 M-series expanded that to sixteen modules, and the 1000
   E/F-series expanded that still further to sixty-four modules.  Each CPU had
   its own microinstruction set, although the micromachines of the various 1000
   models were similar internally.

   The UIG instructions were divided into ranges assigned to HP firmware
   options, reserved for future HP use, and reserved for user microprograms.
   User microprograms could occupy any range not already used on a given
   machine, but in practice, some effort was made to avoid the HP-reserved
   ranges.

   User microprogram simulation is supported by routing any UIG instruction not
   allocated to an installed firmware option to a user-firmware dispatcher.
   Site-specific microprograms may be simulated there.  In the absence of such a
   simulation, an unimplemented instruction stop will occur.

   Regarding option instruction sets, there was some commonality across CPU
   types.  EAU instructions were identical across all models, and the floating
   point set was the same on the 2100 and 1000.  Other options implemented
   proper instruction supersets (e.g., the Fast FORTRAN Processor from 2100 to
   1000-M to 1000-E to 1000-F) or functional equivalence with differing code
   points (the 2000 I/O Processor from 2100 to 1000, and the extended-precision
   floating-point instructions from 1000-E to 1000-F).

   The 2100 decoded the EAU and UIG sets separately in hardware and supported
   only the UIG 0 code points.  Bits 7-4 of a UIG instruction decoded one of
   sixteen entry points in the lowest-numbered module after module 0.  Those
   entry points could be used directly (as for the floating-point instructions),
   or additional decoding based on bits 3-0 could be implemented.

   The 1000 generalized the instruction decoding to a series of microcoded
   jumps, based on the bits in the instruction.  Bits 15-8 indicated the group
   of the current instruction: EAU (200, 201, 202, 210, and 211), UIG 0 (212),
   or UIG 1 (203 and 213).  UIG 0, UIG 1, and some EAU instructions were decoded
   further by selecting one of sixteen modules within the group via bits 7-4.
   Finally, each UIG module decoded up to sixteen instruction entry points via
   bits 3-0.  Jump tables for all firmware options were contained in the base
   set, so modules needed only to be concerned with decoding their individual
   entry points within the module.

   While the 2100 and 1000 hardware decoded these instruction sets differently,
   the decoding mechanism of the simulation follows that of the 1000 E/F-series.
   Where needed, CPU type- or model-specific behavior is simulated.

   The design of the 1000 microinstruction set was such that executing an
   instruction for which no microcode was present (e.g., executing a FFP
   instruction when the FFP firmware was not installed) resulted in a NOP.
   Under simulation, such execution causes an unimplemented instruction stop if
   "STOP (cpu_ss_unimpl)" is non-zero and a no-operation otherwise.

/* EAU

   The Extended Arithmetic Unit (EAU) adds ten instructions with double-word
   operands, including multiply, divide, shifts, and rotates.  Option
   implementation by CPU was as follows:

      2114    2115    2116    2100   1000-M  1000-E  1000-F

      N/A    12579A  12579A   std     std     std     std

   The instruction codes are mapped to routines as follows:

   The remaining codes for bits 7-4 are undefined and will cause a simulator
   stop if enabled.  On a real 1000-M, all undefined instructions in the 200
   group decode as MPY, and all in the 202 group decode as NOP.  On a real
   1000-E, instruction patterns 200/05 through 200/07 and 202/03 decode as NOP;
   all others cause erroneous execution.

   EAU instruction decoding on the 1000 M-series is convoluted.  The JEAU
   microorder maps IR bits 11, 9-7 and 5-4 to bits 2-0 of the microcode jump
   address.  The map is detailed on page IC-84 of the ERD.

   The 1000 E/F-series add two undocumented instructions to the 200 group: TIMER
   and DIAG.  These are described in the ERD on page IA 5-5, paragraph 5-7.  The
   M-series executes these as MPY and RRL, respectively.  A third instruction,
   EXECUTE (100120), is also described but was never implemented, and the
   E/F-series microcode execute a NOP for this instruction code.

   If the EAU is not installed in a 2115 or 2116, EAU instructions execute as
   NOPs or cause unimplemented instruction stops if enabled.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Under simulation, TIMER and DIAG cause undefined instruction stops if the
       CPU is not an E/F-Series.  Note that TIMER is intentionally executed by
       several HP programs to differentiate between M- and E/F-series machines.

    2. DIAG is not implemented under simulation.  On the E/F, it performs a
       destructive test of all installed memory.  Because of this, it is only
       functional if the machine is halted, i.e., if the instruction is
       executed with the INSTR STEP button.  If it is executed in a program,
       the result is NOP.

    3. The RRR 16 instruction is intentionally executed by the diagnostic
       configurator on the 2114, which does not have an EAU, to differentiate
       between 2114 and 2100/1000 CPUs.

    4. The shift count is calculated unconditionally, as six of the ten
       instructions will be using the value.

    5. An arithmetic left shift must be handled as a special case because the
       shifted operand bits "skip over" the sign bit.  That is, the bits are
       lost from the next-most-significant bit while preserving the MSB.  For
       all other shifts, including the arithmetic right shift, the operand may
       be shifted and then merged with the appropriate fill bits.

    6. The C standard specifies that the results of bitwise shifts with negative
       signed operands are undefined (for left shifts) or implementation-defined
       (for right shifts).  Therefore, we must use unsigned operands and handle
       arithmetic shifts explicitly.

   If the 2100 IOP is installed, the only valid UIG instructions are IOP
   instructions, as the IOP used the full 2100 microcode addressing space.  The
   IOP dispatcher remaps the 2100 codes to 1000 codes for execution.

   The F-Series moved the three-word extended real instructions from the FFP
   range to the base floating-point range and added four-word double real and
   two-word double integer instructions.  The double integer instructions
   occupied some of the vacated extended real instruction codes in the FFP, with
   the rest assigned to the floating-point range.  Consequently, many
   instruction codes for the F-Series are different from the E-Series.

   Implementation notes:

    1. Product 93585A, available from the "Specials" group, added double integer
       microcode to the E-Series.  The instruction codes were different from
       those in the F-Series to avoid conflicting with the E-Series FFP.

    2. To run the double-integer instructions diagnostic in the absence of
       64-bit integer support (and therefore of F-Series simulation), a special
       DBI dispatcher may be enabled by defining ENABLE_DIAG during compilation.
       This dispatcher will remap the F-Series DBI instructions to the E-Series
       codes, so that the F-Series diagnostic may be run.  Because several of
       the F-Series DBI instruction codes replace M/E-Series FFP codes, this
       dispatcher will only operate if FFP is disabled.

       Note that enabling the dispatcher will produce non-standard FP behavior.
       For example, any code in the range 105000-105017 normally would execute a
       FAD instruction.  With the dispatcher enabled, 105014 would execute a
       .DAD, while the other codes would execute a FAD.  Therefore, ENABLE_DIAG
       should only be used to run the diagnostic and is not intended for general
       use.

    3. Any instruction not claimed by an installed option will be sent to the
       user microcode dispatcher.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The Distributed System (DS) microcode was mapped to different instruction
       ranges for the M-Series and the E/F-Series.  The sequence of instructions
       was identical, though, so we remap the former range to the latter before
       dispatching.

    2. Any instruction not claimed by an installed option will be sent to the
       user microcode dispatcher.

/* Get instruction operands.

   Operands for a given instruction are specifed by an "operand pattern"
   consisting of flags indicating the types and storage methods.  The pattern
   directs how each operand is to be retrieved and whether the operand value or
   address is returned in the operand array.

   Typically, a microcode simulation handler will define an OP_PAT array, with
   each element containing an operand pattern corresponding to the simulated
   instruction.  Operand patterns are defined in the header file accompanying
   this source file.  After calling this function with the appropriate operand
   pattern and a pointer to an array of OPs, operands are decoded and stored
   sequentially in the array.

   The following operand encodings are defined:

   Address operands, i.e., those having a DEF to the operand, will be resolved
   to direct addresses.  If an interrupt is pending and more than three levels
   of indirection are used, the routine returns without completing operand
   retrieval (the instruction will be retried after interrupt servicing).
   Addresses are always resolved in the current DMS map.

   An operand pattern consists of one or more operand encodings, corresponding
   to the operands required by a given instruction.  Values are returned in
   sequence to the operand array.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The reads of address operand words that follow an instruction (e.g., the
       DEFs above) are classified as instruction fetches.  The reads of the
       operands themselves are classified as data accesses.

/* Format an error code in the A and B registers.

   This routine conditionally formats the contents of the A and B registers into
   an error message.  If the supplied "success" flag is 0, the A and B registers
   contain a four-character error code (e.g., "EM82"), with the leading
   characters in the B register.  The characters are moved into the error
   message, and a pointer to the message is returned.  If "success" is non-zero,
   then a pointer to the message reporting normal execution is returned.

   The routine is typically called from an instructio executor during operand
   tracing.
