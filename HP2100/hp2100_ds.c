   The 13037D multiple-access (MAC) disc controller supports from one to eight
   HP 7905 (15 MB), 7906 (20MB), 7920 (50 MB), and 7925 (120 MB) disc drives
   accessed by one to eight CPUs.  The controller hardware consists of a 16-bit
   microprogrammed processor constructed from 74S181 bit slices operating at 5
   MHz, a device controller providing the interconnections to the drives and CPU
   interfaces, and an error correction controller that enables the correction of
   up to 32-bit error bursts.  1024 words of 24-bit firmware are stored in ROM.

   The 13175D disc interface is used to connect the HP 1000 CPU to the 13037
   device controller.  In a multiple-CPU system, one interface is strapped to
   reset the controller when the CPU's front panel PRESET button is pressed.

   This module simulates a 13037D connected to a single 13175D interface.  From
   one to eight drives may be connected, and drive types may be freely
   intermixed.  A unit that is enabled but not attached appears to be a
   connected drive that does not have a disc pack in place.  A unit that is
   disabled appears to be disconnected.

   This simulator is an adaptation of the code originally written by Bob Supnik.
   The functions of the controller have been separated from the functions of the
   interface, with the former placed into a separate disc controller library.
   This allows the library to support other CPU interfaces, such as the 12821A
   HP-IB disc interface, that use substantially different communication
   protocols.  The library functions implement the controller command set for
   the drive units.  The interface functions handle the transfer of commands and
   data to and from the CPU.

   In hardware, the controller runs continuously in one of three states: in the
   Poll Loop (idle state), in the Command Wait Loop (wait state), or in command
   execution (busy state).  In simulation, the controller is run only when a
   command is executing or when a transition into or out of the two loops might
   occur.  Internally, the controller handles these transitions:

    - when a command other than End terminates (busy => wait)
    - when the End command terminates (busy => idle)
    - when a command timeout occurs (wait => idle)
    - when a parameter timeout occurs (busy => idle)
    - when a seek completes (if idle and interrupts are enabled, idle => wait)

   The interface must call the controller library to handle these transitions:

    - when a command is received from the CPU (idle or wait => busy)
    - when interrupts are enabled (if idle and drive Attention, idle => wait)

   In addition, each transition to the wait state must check for a pending
   command, and each transition to the idle state must check for both a pending
   command and a drive with Attention status asserted.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Although the 13175D has a 16-word FIFO, the "full" level is set at 5
       entries in hardware to avoid a long DCPC preemption time at the start of
       a disc write as the FIFO fills.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The validation routine does not allow the model number or autosizing
       option to be changed when the unit is attached.  Therefore, specifying
       UNIT_ATT in the mask field has no adverse effect.

    2. The modifier DEVNO is deprecated in favor of SC but is retained for
       compatibility.

   The 13175D disc interface data path consists of an input multiplexer/latch
   and a 16-word FIFO buffer.  The FIFO source may be either the CPU's I/O
   input bus or the controller's interface data bus.  The output of the FIFO may
   be enabled either to the CPU's I/O output bus or the interface data bus.

   The control path consists of the usual control, flag buffer, flag, and SRQ
   flip-flops, although flag and SRQ are decoupled to allow the full DCPC
   transfer rate through the FIFO (driving SRQ from the flag limits transfers to
   every other cycle).  SRQ is based on the FIFO level: if data or room in the
   FIFO is available, SRQ is set to initiate a transfer.  The flag is only used
   to signal an interrupt at the end of a command.

   One unusual aspect is that SFC and SFS test different things, rather than
   complementary states of the same thing.  SFC tests the controller busy state,
   and SFS tests the flag flip-flop.

   In addition, the card contains end-of-data-transfer, command-follows, and
   command-ready flip-flops.  EDT is set when the DCPC EDT signal is asserted
   and is used in conjunction with the FIFO level to assert the end-of-data
   signal to the controller.  The command-follows flip-flop is set by a CLC to
   indicate that the next data word output from the CPU is a disc command.  The
   command-ready flip-flop is set when a command is received to schedule an
   interface poll.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, SRQ is enabled only when the controller is reading or
       writing the disc (IFIN or IFOUT functions are asserted) and set when the
       FIFO is not empty (read) or not full (write).  In simulation, SRQ is set
       by the unit service read/write data phase transfers and cleared in the
       IOI and IOO signal handlers when the FIFO is empty (read) or full
       (write).

    2. The DCPC EDT signal cannot set the controller's end-of-data flag directly
       because a write EOD must occur only after the FIFO has been drained.

    3. Polling the interface or drives must be deferred to the end of I/O signal
       handling.  If they are performed in the IOO/STC handlers themselves, an
       associated CLF might clear the flag that was set by the poll.

    4. Executing a CLC sets the controller's end-of-data flag, which will abort
       a read or write data transfer in progress.  Parameter transfers are not
       affected.  If a command is received when a parameter is expected, the
       word is interpreted as data, even though the command-ready flip-flop is
       set.  The controller firmware only checks DTRDY for a parameter transfer,
       and DTRDY is asserted whenever the FIFO is not empty.

    5. The hardware Interface Function and Flag Buses are not implemented
       explicitly.  Instead, interface functions and signals are inferred by the
       interface from the current command operation and phase.

/* Service the disc drive unit.

   The unit service routine is called to execute scheduled controller commands
   for the specified unit.  The actions to be taken depend on the current state
   of the controller and the unit.

   Generally, the controller library service routine handles all of the disc
   operations except data transfer to and from the interface.  Read transfers
   are responsible for loading words from the sector buffer into the FIFO and
   enabling SRQ.  If the current sector transfer is complete, either due to EDT
   assertion or buffer exhaustion, the controller is moved to the end phase to
   complete or continue the read with the next sector.  In either case, the unit
   is rescheduled.  If the FIFO overflows, the read terminates with a data
   overrun error.

   Write transfers set the initial SRQ to request words from the CPU.  As each
   word arrives, it is unloaded from the FIFO into the sector buffer, and SRQ is
   enabled.  If the current sector transfer is complete, the controller is moved
   to the end phase.  If the FIFO underflows, the write terminates with a data
   overrun error.

   The synchronous nature of the disc drive requires that data be supplied or
   accepted continuously by the CPU.  DCPC generally assures that this occurs,
   and the FIFO allows for some latency before an overrun or underrun occurs.

   The other operation the interface must handle is seek completion.  The
   controller handles seek completion by setting Attention status in the drive's
   status word.  The interface is responsible for polling the drives if the
   controller is idle and interrupts are enabled.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Every command except Seek, Recalibrate, and End sets the flag when the
       command completes.  A command completes when the controller is no longer
       busy (it becomes idle for Seek, Recalibrate, and End, or it becomes
       waiting for all others).  Seek and Recalibrate may generate errors (e.g.,
       heads unloaded), in which case the flag must be set.  But in these cases,
       the controller state is waiting, not idle.

       However, it is insufficient simply to check that the controller has moved
       to the wait state, because a seek may complete while the controller is
       waiting for the next command.  For example, a Seek is started on unit 0,
       and the controller moves to the idle state.  But before the seek
       completes, another command is issued that attempts to access unit 1,
       which is not ready.  The command fails with a Status-2 error, and the
       controller moves to the wait state.  When the seek completes, the
       controller is waiting with error status.  We must determine whether the
       seek completed successfully or not, as we must interrupt in the latter
       case.

       Therefore, we determine seek completion by checking if the Attention
       status was set.  Attention sets only if the seek completes successfully.

       (Actually, Attention sets if a seek check occurs, but in that case, the
       command terminated before the seek ever started.  Also, a seek may
       complete while the controller is busy, waiting, or idle.)

    2. For debug printouts, we want to print the name of the command that has
       completed when the controller returns to the idle or wait state.
       Normally, we would use the controller's "opcode" field to identify the
       command that completed.  However, while waiting for Seek or Recalibrate
       completion, "opcode" may be set to another command if that command does
       not access this drive.  For example, it might be set to a Read of another
       unit, or a Request Status for this unit.  So we can't rely on "opcode" to
       report the correct name of the completed positioning command.

       However, we cannot rely on "uptr->OP" either, as that can be changed
       during the course of a command.  For example, Read Without Verify is
       changed to Read after a track crossing.

       Instead, we have to determine whether a seek is completing.  If it is,
       then we report "uptr->OP"; otherwise, we report "opcode".

    3. The initial write SRQ must set only at the transition from the start
       phase to the data phase.  If a write command begins with an auto-seek,
       the drive service will be entered twice in the start phase (the first
       entry performs the seek, and the second begins the write).  In hardware,
       SRQ does not assert until the write begins.

    4. The DCPC EDT signal cannot set the controller's end-of-data flag
       directly because a write EOD must only occur after the FIFO has been
       drained.

   The controller service routine is called to execute scheduled controller
   commands that do not access drive units.  It is also called to obtain command
   parameters from the interface and to return command result values to the
   interface.

   Most controller commands are handled completely in the library's service
   routine, so we call that first.  Commands that neither accept nor supply
   parameters are complete when the library routine returns, so all we have to
   do is set the interface flag if required.

   For parameter transfers in the data phase, the interface is responsible for
   moving words between the sector buffer and the FIFO and setting the flag to
   notify the CPU.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, the Read With Offset command sets the data flag after the
       offset parameter has been read and the head positioner has been moved by
       the indicated amount.  The intent is to delay the DCPC start until the
       drive is ready to supply data from the disc.

       In simulation, the flag is set as soon as the parameter is received.

   Implementation notes:

    1. During a power-on reset, a pointer to the FIFO simulation register is

       that the bottom word of the FIFO is always displayed as FIFO[0],
       regardless of where it is in the actual FIFO array.

    2. SRQ is denied because neither IFIN nor IFOUT is asserted when the
       interface is not selected.

/* Boot a MAC disc drive.

   The MAC disc bootstrap program is loaded from the HP 12992B Boot Loader ROM
   into memory, the I/O instructions are configured for the interface card's
   select code, and the program is run to boot from the specified unit.  The
   loader supports booting from cylinder 0 of drive unit 0 only.  Before
   execution, the S register is automatically set as follows:

     15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
     ------  ------  ----------------------   ---------   ---------
     ROM #    0   1       select code         reserved      head

   The boot routine sets bits 15-6 of the S register to appropriate values.
   Bits 5-3 and 1-0 retain their original values, so S should be set before
   booting.  These bits are typically set to 0, although bit 5 is set for an RTE
   reconfiguration boot, and bits 1-0 may be set if booting from a head other
   than 0 is desired.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The Loader ROMs manual indicates that bits 2-0 select the head to use,
       implying that heads 0-7 are valid.  However, Table 5 has entries only for
       heads 0-3, and the boot loader code will malfunction if heads 4-7 are
       specified.  The code masks the head number to three bits but forms the
       Cold Load Read command by shifting the head number six bits to the left.
       As the head field in the command is only two bits wide, specifying heads
       4-7 will result in bit 2 being shifted into the opcode field, resulting
       in a Recalibrate command.

   The previously prepared command is executed by calling the corresponding
   library routine.  On entry, the controller's opcode field contains the
   command to start, and the buffer contains the command word in element 0 and
   the parameters required by the command, if any, beginning in element 1.

   If the command started, the returned pointer will point at the unit to
   activate (if that unit's "wait" field is non-zero).  If the returned pointer
   is NULL, the command failed to start, and the controller status has been set
   to indicate the reason.  The interface flag is set to notify the CPU of the
   failure.


   Implementation notes:

    1. If a command that accesses the drive is attempted on a drive currently
       seeking, the returned pointer will be valid, but the unit's "wait" time
       will be zero.  The unit must not be activated (as it already is active).
       When the seek completes, the command will be executed automatically.

       If a Seek or Cold Load Read command is attempted on a drive currently
       seeking, seek completion will occur normally, but Seek Check status will
       be set.

    2. For debug printouts, we want to print the name of the command (Seek or
       Recalibrate) in progress when a new command is started.  However, when
       the library routine returns, the unit operation and controller opcode
       have been changed to reflect the new command.  Therefore, we must record
       the operation in progress before calling the library.

       The problem is in determining which unit's operation code to record.  We
       cannot blindly use the unit field from the new command, as recorded in
       the controller, as preparation has ensured only that the target unit
       number is legal but not necessarily valid.  Therefore, we must validate
       the unit number before accessing the unit's operation code.

       If the unit number is invalid, the command will not start, but the
       compiler does not know this.  Therefore, we must ensure that the saved
       operation code is initialized, or a "variable used uninitialized" warning
       will occur.

/* Load a word into the FIFO.

   A word is loaded into the next available location in the FIFO, and the FIFO
   occupancy count is incremented.  If the FIFO is full on entry, the load is
   ignored.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The FIFO is implemented as circular queue to take advantage of REG_CIRC
       EXAMINE semantics.  REG->qptr is the index of the first word currently in
       the FIFO.  By specifying REG_CIRC, examining FIFO[0-n] will always
       display the words in load order, regardless of the actual array index of
       the start of the list.  The number of words currently present in the FIFO
       is kept in fifo_count (0 = empty, 1-16 = number of words available).

       If fifo_count < FIFO_SIZE, (REG->qptr + fifo_count) mod FIFO_SIZE is the
       index of the new word location.  Loading stores the word there and then
       increments fifo_count.

    2. Because the load and unload routines need access to qptr in the REG
       structure for the FIFO array, a pointer to the REG is stored in the
       fifo_reg variable during device reset.
