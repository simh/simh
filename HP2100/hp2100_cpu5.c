   The RTE-IV and RTE-IVB Extended Memory Array instructions and the RTE-6/VM
   Virtual Memory Area instructions were added to accelerate the logical-to-
   physical address translations and array subscript calculations of programs
   running under the RTE-IV (HP product number 92067A), RTE-IVB (92068A), and
   RTE-6/VM (92084A) operating systems.  Microcode was available for the E- and
   F-Series; the M-Series used software equivalents.

   Both EMA and VMA opcodes reside in the range 105240-105257, so only one or
   the other could be installed in a given system.  This did not present a
   difficulty, as VMA was a superset of EMA.  The EMA encodings are:

   The .EMIO instruction maps a buffer of the indicated size and starting at the
   indicated array location into memory.  It ensures that the buffer is entirely
   within the logical address space in preparation for an I/O operation.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The MMAP instruction maps a sequence of physical memory pages into the
   mapping segment area of a program's logical address space.  The A-register
   value on return indicates the success or failure of the request.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The emtst instruction is used to determine if the EMA firmware has been
   installed.  If it is executed in single-step mode, it sets S to 102077 (HLT
   77B).  It executes as NOP from a running program.

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The .EMAP instruction resolves an array access into the memory address of the
   referenced element.  If the array is in EMA, it also maps the element into
   the mapping segment.


   The VMA instruction encodings are:

      15 |14  13  12 |11  10   9 | 8   7   6 | 5   4   3 | 2   1   0

     :               return location if page is mapped               :  P+2
     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The .PMAP instruction maps the memory page whose physical page number is in
   the B-register into the map register specified by the A-register.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The $LOC instruction implements load-on-call for MLS/LOC programs..

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The vmtst instruction is used to determine programmatically if the VMA
   firmware has been installed.  It sets the X-register to the firmware revision
   code, sets Y to 1, sets S to 102077 (HLT 77B), and returns to P+2.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .SWP instruction swaps the A- and B-register values.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   These instructions are not implemented and will cause an unimplemented
   instruction stop if enabled.


      15 |14  13  12 |11  10   9 | 8   7   6 | 5   4   3 | 2   1   0

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .UMPY instruction performs an unsigned multiply-and-add.  The A-register
   contains the multiplicand, and the B-register contains the augend.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The comments prededing the .LBP microcode are wrong with regard to the
       VSEG map setup when the first mapped page is the last page in the VM
       area.  They claim, "THE MICROCODE WILL MAP IN PHYSICAL PAGE 1023 MARKING
       IT READ/WRITE PROTECTED.  ANY ACCESS TO THIS PAGE WILL PRODUCE A DMS
       ERROR."  Actually, the microcode sets the second map register to point at
       the last page (same as the first map register), and the page is not
       protected.  This means that a spillover access beyond the last VM page
       will corrupt the last VM page instead of causing a DM abort as intended.
       Ths simulator follows the microcode in reproducing this bug.

/* RTE-6/VM Virtual Memory Area Instructions

   RTE-6/VM (product number 92084A) introduced Virtual Memory Area (VMA)
   instructions -- a superset of the RTE-IV EMA instructions.  Different
   microcode was supplied with the operating system that replaced the microcode
   used with RTE-IV.  Microcode was limited to the E/F-Series, and the M-Series
   used software equivalents.

   Option implementation by CPU was as follows:

      2114    2115    2116    2100   1000-M  1000-E  1000-F
     ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------
      N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A    92084A  92084A

   The routines are mapped to instruction codes as follows:

     Instr.  1000-E/F   Description
     ------  --------  ----------------------------------------------
     .PMAP    105240   Map VMA page into map register
     $LOC     105241   Load on call
     [test]   105242   [self test]
     .SWP     105243   [Swap A and B registers]
     .STAS    105244   [STA B; LDA SP]
     .LDAS    105245   [LDA SP]
     .MYAD    105246   [NOP in microcode]
     .UMPY    105247   [Unsigned multiply and add]

     .IMAP    105250   Integer element resolve address and map
     .IMAR    105251   Integer element resolve address
     .JMAP    105252   Double integer element resolve address and map
     .JMAR    105253   Double integer element resolve address
     .LPXR    105254   Map pointer in P+1 plus offset in P+2
     .LPX     105255   Map pointer in A/B plus offset in P+1
     .LBPR    105256   Map pointer in P+1
     .LBP     105257   Map pointer in A/B registers

   Implementation notes:

    1. The opcodes 105243-247 are undocumented and do not appear to be used in
       any HP software.

    2. The opcode list in the CE Handbook incorrectly shows 105246 as ".MYAD -
       multiply 2 signed integers."  The microcode listing shows that this
       instruction was deleted, and the opcode is now a NOP.

    3. RTE-IV EMA and RTE-6 VMA instructions shared the same address space, so a
       given machine could run one or the other, but not both.

/* RTE-IV Extended Memory Area Instructions

   The RTE-IV operating system (HP product number 92067A) introduced the
   Extended Memory Area (EMA) instructions.  EMA provided a mappable data area
   up to one megaword in size.  These three instructions accelerated data
   accesses to variables stored in EMA partitions.  Support was limited to
   E/F-Series machines; M-Series machines used software equivalents.

   Option implementation by CPU was as follows:

      2114    2115    2116    2100   1000-M  1000-E  1000-F
     ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------
      N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A    92067A  92067A

   The routines are mapped to instruction codes as follows:

     Instr.  1000-E/F   Description
     ------  --------  ----------------------------------------------
     .EMIO    105240   EMA I/O
     MMAP     105241   Map physical to logical memory
     emtst    105242   [self test]
     .EMAP    105257   Resolve array element address

   Notes:

     1. RTE-IV EMA and RTE-6 VMA instructions share the same address space, so a
        given machine can run one or the other, but not both.

     2. The EMA diagnostic (92067-16013) reports bogus MMAP failures if it is
        not loaded at the start of its partition (e.g., because of a LOADR "LO"
        command).  The "ICMPS" map comparison check in the diagnostic assumes
        that the starting page of the program's partition contains the first
        instruction of the program and prints "MMAP ERROR" if it does not.
