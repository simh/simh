   The RTE-IV and RTE-IVB Extended Memory Array instructions and the RTE-6/VM
   Virtual Memory Area instructions were added to accelerate the logical-to-
   physical address translations and array subscript calculations of programs
   running under the RTE-IV (HP product number 92067A), RTE-IVB (92068A), and
   RTE-6/VM (92084A) operating systems.  Microcode was available for the E- and
   F-Series; the M-Series used software equivalents.

   Both EMA and VMA opcodes reside in the range 105240-105257, so only one or
   the other could be installed in a given system.  This did not present a
   difficulty, as VMA was a superset of EMA.  The EMA encodings are:

   The .EMIO instruction maps a buffer of the indicated size and starting at the
   indicated array location into memory.  It ensures that the buffer is entirely
   within the logical address space in preparation for an I/O operation.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The MMAP instruction maps a sequence of physical memory pages into the
   mapping segment area of a program's logical address space.  The A-register
   value on return indicates the success or failure of the request.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The emtst instruction is used to determine if the EMA firmware has been
   installed.  If it is executed in single-step mode, it sets S to 102077 (HLT
   77B).  It executes as NOP from a running program.

   The .EMAP instruction resolves an array access into the memory address of the
   referenced element.  If the array is in EMA, it also maps the element into
   the mapping segment.



   The Vector Instruction Set (VIS) provides instructions that operate on
   one-dimensional arrays of floating-point values.  Both single- and
   double-precision operations are supported.  VIS uses the F-Series
   floating-point processor to handle the floating-point math, so the firmware
   is supported only on that machine.

   Instructions use IR bit 11 to select single- or double-precision format.  The
   double-precision instruction names begin with "D" (e.g., DVADD vs. VADD).
   Most VIS instructions are two words in length, with a sub-opcode immediately
   following the primary opcode.

   The two-word instructions are interruptible.  the firmware sets bit 15 of the
   second word to 1 to indicate that the instruction has been interrupted.  This
   allows the instruction to resume at the correct point in the vector
   operation.  Bit 15 is set to 0 before exiting for instruction completion.

   The .ESEG instruction behaves slightly differently when invoked with the
   105475 opcode.  The microcode source calls it a .VPRG instruction, but the
   only difference is that it sets the MSEG start and size to 0 and 32,
   respectively, instead of obtaining them from the ID extension.  In all other
   respects, the instructions are identical.

   The .ERES, .VSET, and test instructions do not test bit 11, so they will be
   invoked with either the 101xxx or 105xxx forms.  The 101xxx forms are
   canonical for the first two, while the 105xxx form is canonical for the
   self-test instruction.

   The VIS encodings are:

   The test instruction is used to determine if the VIS firmware has been
   installed.  It sets X to the firmware revision code, S to 102077 (HLT 77B)
   and skips the next instruction if the microcode is present.



   The SIGNAL/1000 instructions provide fast Fourier transforms and complex
   arithmetic.  They utilize the F-Series floating-point processor and the
   Vector Instruction Set, so the firmware is supported only on the F-Series
   CPU.

   The SIGNAL encodings are:

   The test instruction is used to determine if the SIGNAL firmware has been
   installed.  It sets X to the firmware revision code, S to 102077 (HLT 77B)
   and skips the next instruction if the microcode is present.


   Implementation notes:

    1. As the VIS and SIGNAL firmware uses the F-Series Floating-Point
       Processor, and the FPP simulator requires 64-bit integer support, VIS and
       SIGNAL also require 64-bit support.

/* RTE-IV Extended Memory Array instructions.

   The RTE-IV operating system (HP product number 92067A) introduced the
   Extended Memory Area (EMA) instructions.  EMA provided a mappable data area
   up to one megaword in size.  These three instructions accelerated data
   accesses to variables stored in EMA partitions.  Support was limited to
   E/F-Series machines; M-Series machines used software equivalents.

   Option implementation by CPU was as follows:

      2114    2115    2116    2100   1000-M  1000-E  1000-F
     ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------
      N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A    92067A  92067A

   The routines are mapped to instruction codes as follows:

     Instr.  1000-E/F   Description
     ------  --------  ----------------------------------------------
     .EMIO    105240   EMA I/O
     MMAP     105241   Map physical to logical memory
     emtst    105242   [self test]
     .EMAP    105257   Resolve array element address

    - RTE-IVB Technical Specifications (92068-90013, January 1980).


   Implemenation notes:

     1. RTE-IV EMA and RTE-6 VMA instructions share the same address space, so a
        given machine can run one or the other, but not both.

     2. The EMA diagnostic (92067-16013) reports bogus MMAP failures if it is
        not loaded at the start of its partition (e.g., because of a LOADR "LO"
        command).  The "ICMPS" map comparison check in the diagnostic assumes
        that the starting page of the program's partition contains the first
        instruction of the program and prints "MMAP ERROR" if it does not.

   The VIS provides instructions that operate on one-dimensional arrays of
   floating-point values.  Both single- and double-precision operations are
   supported.  VIS uses the F-Series floating-point processor to handle the
   floating-point math.

   Option implementation by CPU was as follows:

      2114    2115    2116    2100   1000-M  1000-E  1000-F

   Instructions use IR bit 11 to select single- or double-precision format.  The
   double-precision instruction names begin with "D" (e.g., DVADD vs. VADD).
   Most VIS instructions are two words in length, with a sub-opcode immediately
   following the primary opcode.

   Implementation notes:

     1. The .VECT (101460) and .DVCT (105460) opcodes preface a single- or
        double-precision arithmetic operation that is determined by the
        sub-opcode value.  The remainder of the dual-precision sub-opcode values
        are "don't care," except for requiring a zero in bit 15.

     2. The VIS uses the hardware FPP of the F-Series.  FPP malfunctions are
        detected by the VIS firmware and are indicated by a memory-protect
        violation and setting the overflow flag.  Under simulation,
        malfunctions cannot occur.
