   The RTE-6/VM Operating System Instructions were added to accelerate certain
   time-consuming operations of the RTE-6/VM operating system, HP product number
   92084A.  Microcode was available for the E- and F-Series; the M-Series used
   software equivalents.

   The opcodes reside in the range 105340-105357.  The encodings are:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     |          address of the Temporary Data Block or zero          |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The $LIBR instruction saves the data contained in the Temporary Data Block of
   a reentrant subroutine or turns the interrupt system off for a privileged
   subroutine.  The parameter points to the TDB or is zero, respectively.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The $LIBX instruction restores the data contained in the Temporary Data Block
   of a reentrant subroutine or turns the interrupt system on for a privileged
   subroutine and then returns to the routine's caller.  The parameter points to
   the subroutine entry point, which contains the return address.

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The .TICK instruction increments the timeout counters of a set of EQTs.  On
   entry, the A register contains the address of word 15 of the first EQT, and
   the B register contains the count of EQTs to process.  If an EQT timed out,
   the instruction returns at P+1 with the A register pointing at word 15 of the
   EQT, and the B register containing the remaining number of EQTs to process.
   If no EQT timed out, the instruction returns at P+2 with the A register
   pointing at word 15 of the EQT following the last one checked, and the B
   register containing zero.

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The .TNAM instruction finds the ID segment address corresponding to a given
   program name.  On entry, the A register contains the address of the keyword
   block, and the B register contains a pointer to the program name.  If the ID
   segment is found, return is to P+2 with the A register containing the address
   of word 15 of the ID segment, the B register containing the address of the ID
   segment, and the E register set to 1 for a short ID segment and 0 for a long
   ID segment.  If the ID segment is not found, return is to P+1 with the
   registers unspecified.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .STIO instruction configures a list of I/O instructions.  On entry, each
   parameter following the return address points at an instruction to configure
   with the select code specified in the A register.  The instruction returns
   with all registers unchanged.

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The .FNW instruction finds a word in a buffer.  On entry, the A register
   contains the value of the word to find, the B register contains the address
   of the buffer, the X register contains the number of words to compare, and
   the first parameter points to the increment between words.  If the word was
   found, return is to P+3 with the match address in the B register and the
   count of remaining comparisons in the X register.  If the word was not found,
   return is to P+2 with the address of the next comparison location in the B
   register and zero in the X register.  The A register is unchanged in either
   case.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .IRT instruction is used to return from an interrupt.  It restores the A,
   B, E, O, X, and Y registers from the XSUSP and XI save areas and restores the
   P register from XSUSP,I into the location specified by the parameter, which
   will be the jump target of a following UJP or SJP instruction.

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The .LLS instruction conducts a linked-list search.  On entry, the A register
   contains a pointer to the head of the list, the B register is zero, and the E
   register is 0 to find a value matching the search value or 1 to find a value
   greater than the search value.  The first parameter points at the value to
   find, and the second parameter points at the offset within each list entry
   from the link pointer to the value to compare.  The instruction returns to
   P+3 if the list structure is erroneous (a link has its sign bit set), to P+4
   if the search value is not present in the list, or to P+5 if the search value
   was found.  In the latter two cases, the A register points to the link word
   of the current entry, and the B register points to the link word of the
   previous entry.

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The .SIP instruction skips if an interrupt is pending.  It is used to avoid
   exiting and then immediately reentering RTE when an interrupt is pending at
   exit.  A pending interrupt must be serviced by executing the .YLD
   instruction.


      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     |              point of resumption after interrupt              |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .YLD instruction yields control to the trap cell instruction for the
   pending interrupt.  Before transferring control, the P-register set to the
   value contained in the second instruction word.


      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The .CPM instruction compares the two words pointed to by the parameters and
   returns to P+3 if the words are equal, to P+4 if word 1 is less than word 2,
   or to P+5 if word 1 is greater than word 2.  The registers are unchanged by
   this instruction.


      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .ETEQ instruction sets up the base-page EQT addresses to point at the EQT
   whose address is contained in the A register.


      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .ENTN instruction transfers the direct addresses of parameters from the
   calling sequence of a utility subroutine to the parameter block specified.
   The sequence differs from the .ENTR sequence in that there is no DEF *+n
   parameter immediately following the call, so the number of parameters
   specified must match the size of the parameter block.


      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     +- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -+

   The $OTST instruction is used to determine programmatically if the OS
   firmware has been installed.  It sets the X-register to the firmware revision
   code, sets S to 102077 (HLT 77B), and returns to P+2.  In hardware, it also
   sets Y to the RPL switch settings and sets A to the contents of the loader
   ROM location specified by the B-register.  In simulation, these last two
   actions are not implemented.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .ENTC instruction transfers the direct addresses of parameters from the
   calling sequence of a privileged or reentrant subroutine to the parameter
   block specified.  The sequence differs from the .ENTP sequence in that there
   is no DEF *+n parameter immediately following the call, so the number of
   parameters specified must match the size of the parameter block.

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The .DSPI instruction copies the lower six bits of the A register into the
   display indicator register that controls the A, B, M, T, P, and S LEDs on the
   front panel of the CPU.  This is not simulated.


   Opcodes 105354-105357 are "dual use" instructions that take different
   actions, depending on whether they are executed from a trap cell during an
   interrupt.  When executed from a trap cell, they have these encodings:

   This routine is called from each of the trap cell instructions.  Its purpose

   For the MP/DMS/PE interrupt, the interrupting device must not be cleared and
   the CPU registers must not be saved until it is established that the
   interrupt is not caused by a parity error.  Parity errors cannot be
   inhibited, so the interrupt may have occurred while running in RTE with the
   interrupt system off.  Saving the registers would overwrite the user's
   registers that were saved at RTE entry.  The state of the interrupt system is
   determined by executing a SFS 0,C instruction, which increments P if the
   interrupt system was on, and then turns it off by clearing the flag.

   Note that the trap cell instructions are dual-use and invoke this routine
   only when they are executed during interrupts.  Therefore, the current map
   will always be the system map when we are called.

   Microcode was available for the E- and F-Series; the M-Series used software
   equivalents.

   The routines are mapped to instruction codes as follows:

     Instr.  1000-E/F   Description
     ------  --------  ----------------------------------------------
     $LIBR    105340   Enter privileged/reentrant library routine

     .ENTC    105356   Transfer parameter addresses (priv/reent)
     .DSPI    105357   Set display indicator

   Opcodes 105354-105357 are "dual use" instructions that take different
   actions, depending on whether they are executed from a trap cell during an
   interrupt.  When executed from a trap cell, they have these actions:

     Instr.  1000-E/F   Description
     ------  --------  ----------------------------------------------
     $DCPC *  105354   DCPC channel interrupt processing
     $MPV  *  105355   MP/DMS/PE interrupt processing
     $DEV  *  105356   Standard device interrupt processing
     $TBG  *  105357   TBG interrupt processing

   * These mnemonics are recognized by symbolic examine/deposit but are not
     official HP mnemonics.

   The default (user microcode) dispatcher will allow the firmware self-test
   instruction (105355) to execute as NOP.  This is because RTE-6/VM will always
   test for the presence of OS and VMA firmware on E/F-Series machines.  If the
   firmware is not present, then these instructions will return to P+1, and RTE
   will then HLT 21.  This means that RTE-6/VM will not run on an E/F-Series
   machine without the OS and VMA firmware.

   However, RTE allows the firmware instructions to be disabled for debugging
   purposes.  If the firmware is present and returns to P+2 but sets the X
   register to 0, then RTE will use software equivalents.  We enable this
   condition when the OS firmware is enabled (SET CPU VMA), the OS debug flag is
   set (SET CPU DEBUG=OS), but debug output has been disabled (SET CONSOLE
   NODEBUG).  That is:

                 OS     Debug
     Firmware   Debug   Output   Tracing   Self-Test Instruction
     ========   =====   ======   =======   =====================
     disabled     x       x        off     NOP
     enabled    clear     x        off     X = revision code
     enabled     set     off       off     X = 0
     enabled     set     on        on      X = revision code

   Implementation notes:

    1. The microcode differentiates between interrupt processing and normal
       execution of the "dual use" instructions by testing the CPU flag.
       Interrupt vectoring sets the flag; a normal instruction fetch clears it.
       Under simulation, interrupt vectoring is indicated by the value of the
       "iotrap" parameter (FALSE = normal instruction, TRUE = trap cell
       instruction).

    2. The operand patterns for .ENTN and .ENTC normally would be coded as
       "OP_A", as each takes a single address as a parameter.  However, because
       they might also be executed from a trap cell (as $DCPC and $DEV), we
       cannot assume that P+1 is an address, or we might cause a DM abort when
       trying to resolve indirects.  Therefore, "OP_A" handling is done within
       each routine, once the type of use is determined.

    3. The microcode for .ENTC, .ENTN, .FNW, .LLS, .TICK, and .TNAM explicitly
       checks for interrupts during instruction execution.  In addition, the
       .STIO, .CPM, and .LLS instructions implicitly check for interrupts during
       parameter indirect resolution.  Because the simulator calculates
       interrupt requests only between instructions, this behavior is not
       simulated.

    4. The microcode executes certain I/O instructions (e.g., CLF 0) by building
       the instruction in the IR and executing an IOG micro-order.  We simulate
       this behavior by calling the "cpu_iog" handler with the appropriate
       instruction, rather than manipulating the I/O system directly, so that we
       will remain unaffected by any future changes to the underlying I/O
       simulation structure.

    5. The $OTST and .DSPI microcode provides features (reading the RPL switches
       and boot loader ROM data, loading the display register) that are not
       simulated.  The remaining functions of the $OTST instruction are
       provided.  The .DSPI instruction is a NOP or unimplemented instruction
       stop.

    6. The $LIBX instruction is executed to complete either a privileged or
       reentrant execution.  In the former case, the privileged nest counter
       ($PVCN) is decremented.  In the latter, $PVCN decrement is attempted but
       the write will trap with an MP violation, as reentrant routines execute
       with the interrupt system on.  RTE will then complete the release of
       memory allocated for the original $LIBR call.

    7. The documentation for the .SIP and .YLD instructions is misleading in
       several places.  Comments in the RTE $SIP source file say that .SIP
       doesn't return if a "known" interrupt is pending.  Actually, .SIP always
       returns, either to P+1 for no pending interrupt, or to P+2 if one is
       pending.  There is no check for "known" interrupt handlers.  The
       microcode source comments say that the interrupting select code is
       returned in the B register.  Actually, the B register is unchanged.  The
       RTE Tech Specs say that .SIP "services any pending system interrupts."
       Actually, .SIP only checks for interrupts; no servicing is performed.

       For .YLD, the microcode comments say that two parameters are passed: the
       new P value, and the interrupting select code.  Actually, only the new P
       value is passed.

       The .SIP and .YLD simulations follow the actual microcode rather than the
       documentation.

    8. The "%.0u" print specification in the trace call absorbs the zero "CIR"
       value parameter without printing when an interrupt is not pending.
