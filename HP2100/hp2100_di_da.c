   The HP 7906H, 7920H, and 7925H Integrated Controller Disc (ICD) drives were
   connected via an 12821A disc interface and provided 20MB, 50MB, and 120MB
   capacities.  The drives were identical to the 7906M, 7920M, and 7925M
   Multi-Access Controller (MAC) units but incorporated internal two-card
   controllers in each drive and connected to the CPU interface via the
   Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus (HP-IB), HP's implementation of IEEE-488.  Each
   controller was dedicated to a single drive and operated similarly to the
   12745 Disc Controller to HP-IB Adapter option for the 13037 Disc Controller
   chassis.  The 7906H was introduced in 1980 (there was no 7905H version, as
   the 7905 was obsolete by that time).  Up to four ICD drives could be
   connected to a single 12821A card.  The limitation was imposed by the bus
   loading and the target data transfer rate.

   The ICD command set essentially was the MAC command set modified for
   single-unit operation.  The unit number and CPU hold bit fields in the opcode
   words were unused in the ICD implementation.  The Load TIO Register, Wakeup,
   and Request Syndrome commands were removed, as Load TIO was used with the HP
   3000, Wakeup was used in a multi-CPU environment, and the simpler ICD
   controller did not support ECC.  Controller status values 02B (Unit
   Available) and 27B (Unit Unavailable) were dropped as the controller
   supported only single units, 12B (I/O Program Error) was reused to indicate
   HP-IB protocol errors, 13B (Sync Not Received) was added, and 17B (Possibly
   Correctable Data Error) was removed as error correction was not supported.

   Some minor redefinitions also occurred.  For example, status 14B (End of
   Cylinder) was expanded to include an auto-seek beyond the drive limits, and
   37B (Drive Attention) was restricted just head unloads from head loads and
   unloads.

   The command set was expanded to include several commands related to HP-IB
   operation.  These were, in large part, adapted from the Amigo disc command
   protocol outlined in the service manual for the HP 9133/34/35 series of
   5-1/4" Winchester drives.  They include the Amigo Identify and Amigo Clear
   sequences, Read and Write Loopback channel tests, and controller Self Test
   commands.

   This simulator implements the Amigo disc protocol.  It calls the 12821A Disc
   Interface (DI) simulator to send and receive bytes across the HP-IB to and
   from the CPU, and it calls the HP Disc Library to implement the controller
   functions related to disc unit operation (e.g., seek, read, write, etc.).
   Four units are provided, and any combination of 7906H/20H/25H drives may be
   defined.

   Unfortunately, the primary reference for the ICD controller (the HP 13365
   Integrated Controller Programming Guide) does not indicate parallel poll
   responses for these HP-IB commands.  Therefore, the responses have been
   derived from the sequences in the 7910 and 12745 manuals, although they
   sometimes conflict.

   The drives respond to the following commands; the secondary and opcode
   numeric values are in hex, and the bus addressing state is indicated by U
   [untalk], L [listen], and T [talk]:

   Implementation notes:

    1. The 12745 does not alter the parallel poll response for the
       Device-Specified Jump command.

    2. The 7910 does not perform a parallel poll response enable and disable
       between the Initiate Self-Test and Return Self-Test Result commands.

    3. The 12745 does not disable the parallel poll response for the Read
       Loopback command.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The IFSTAT and IFCMD registers are declared to accommodate the
       corresponding arrays of enums.  Arrayed registers assume that elements
       are allocated space only to the integral number of bytes implied by the
       "width" field.  The storage size of an enum is implementation-defined, so
       we must determine the number of bits for "width" at compile time.
       PV_LEFT is used to avoid the large number of leading zeros that would be
       displayed if an implementation stored enums in full words.

    2. The CNVARS register is included to ensure that the controller state
       variables array is saved by a SAVE command.  It is declared as a hidden,
       read-only byte array of a depth compatible with the size of the array.

       There does not appear to be a way to expose the fields of the four
       controller state variables as arrayed registers.  Access to an array
       always assumes that elements appear at memory offsets equal to the
       element size, i.e., a 32-bit arrayed register has elements at four-byte
       offsets.  There's no way to specify an array of structure elements where
       a given 32-bit field appears at, say, 92-byte offsets (i.e., the size of
       the structure).

/* Service an Amigo disc drive I/O event.

   The service routine is called to execute commands and control the transfer of
   data to and from the HP-IB card.  The actions to be taken depend on the
   current state of the ICD interface.  The possibilities are:

    1. A command is pending on the interface.  This occurs only when a command
       is received while a Seek or Recalibrate command is in progress.

    2. A command is executing.

    3. Data is being sent or received over the HP-IB during command execution.

    4. Dummy bytes are being sent or received over the HP-IB due to a command
       error.

   Entry to the the service routine in any other interface state or to process a
   command not allowed in a valid state will return an Internal Error to cause a
   simulator stop.  Exit from the routine will be either in one of the above
   states, or in the idle state if the operation is complete.

   The specific actions taken for the various interface states are as follows:

   command_wait
   ============

     We are entered in this state only if a unit that was busy (still seeking)
     was addressed to listen or talk.  The card has been held off by asserting
     NRFD after receiving MLA or MTA.  Upon entry, we complete the seek and then
     release the interface by denying NRFD to allow the remainder of the command
     sequence to be received from the card.

   command_exec
   ============

     We are entered in this state to initiate, continue, or complete a command.
     The command may be a disc command, such as Seek or Read, or an interface
     command, such as Amigo Identify or Device-Specified Jump.

     Disc commands call the disc library service routine to perform all of the
     common controller actions.  Any ICD-specific actions needed, such as
     setting the DSJ value, are performed after the call.

     Certain disc commands require multiple execution phases.  For example, the
     Read command has a start phase that reads data from the disc image file
     into the sector buffer, a data phase that transfers bytes from the buffer
     to the card, and an end phase that schedules the intersector gap time and
     resets to the start phase.  Data phase transfers are performed in the
     read_xfer or write_xfer interface states.

     The results of the disc library service are inferred by the controller
     state.  If the controller is busy, then the command continues in a new
     phase.  Otherwise, the command either has completed normally or has
     terminated with an error.  If an error has occurred during a disc command
     that transfers data, DSJ is set to 1, and the interface state is changed to
     source or sink dummy bytes to complete the command sequence.

     Interface commands may either complete immediately (e.g., Amigo Clear) or
     transfer data (e.g., DSJ).

   read_xfer
   =========

     Commands that send data to the CPU enter the service routine to source a
     byte to the bus.  Bytes are transferred only when ATN and NRFD are denied;
     if they are not, we simply exit, as we will be rescheduled when the lines
     are dropped.  Otherwise, we get a byte from the sector buffer and send it
     to the card.  If the card has stopped listening, or the buffer is now
     empty, then we terminate the transfer and move to the end phase of the
     command.  Otherwise, we reschedule the next data phase byte transfer.

     Disc and interface commands are handled separately, as EOI is always
     asserted on the last byte of an interface command transfer and never on a
     (good) disc command transfer.

   write_xfer
   ==========

     Commands that receive data from the CPU enter the service routine to
     determine whether or not to continue the transfer.  Our bus accept routine
     has already stored the received byte in the sector buffer and has asserted
     NRFD to hold off the card.  If the buffer is now full, or the byte was
     tagged with EOI, then we terminate the transfer and move to the end phase
     of the command.  Otherwise, we deny NRFD and exit; we will be rescheduled
     when the next byte arrives.

   error_source
   ============

     If an error occurred during the data transfer phase of a read or status
     command, a dummy byte tagged with EOI is sourced to the bus.  This allows
     the OS driver for the card to terminate the command and request the
     controller's status.

   error_sink
   ==========

     If an error occurred during the data transfer phase of a write command,
     dummy bytes are sunk from the bus until EOI is seen or the card is
     unaddressed.  This allows the OS driver to complete the command as expected
     and then determine the cause of the failure by requesting the controller's
     status.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The disc library sets the controller state to idle for a normal End,
       Seek, or Recalibrate command and to wait for all other commands that end
       normally.  So we determine command completion by checking if the
       controller is not busy, rather than checking if the controller is idle.

       Drive Attention status is the normal result of the completion of a Seek
       or Recalibrate command.  Normal Completion status is the normal result of
       all other commands.

    2. The disc library returns the buffer length in words.  We double the
       return value to count bytes.

    3. Some commands, such as DSJ, could be completed in the bus accept routine.
       They are serviced here instead to avoid presenting a zero execution time
       to the CPU.

    4. The Amigo command set does not provide the disc with the number of bytes
       that will be read, and the unit expects to be untalked when the read is
       to terminate.  The RTE ICD bootstrap extension does not do this.
       Instead, it resets the card via CLC 0,C to terminate the Cold Load Read
       that was started by the ICD boot loader ROM.

       In hardware, if the LSTN control bit is cleared, e.g., by CRS,
       transmission stops because the card denies NDAC and NRFD (the HP-IB
       handshake requires NDAC and NRFD to be asserted to start the handshake
       sequence; TACS * SDYS * ~NDAC * ~NRFD is an error condition).  In
       simulation, we handle this by terminating a read transfer if the card
       stops accepting.  If we did not, then the disc would continue to source
       bytes to the bus, overflowing the card FIFO (a FIFO full condition cannot
       assert NRFD if the LSTN control bit is clear).

   The simulator considers an attached unit to be connected to the bus and an
   unattached unit to be disconnected, so we set the card's acceptor bit for the
   selected unit if the attach is successful.  An attached unit is ready if the
   heads are loaded or not ready if not.

   This model is slightly different than the MAC (DS) simulation, where an
   unattached unit is considered "connected but not ready" -- the same
   indication returned by an attached unit whose heads are unloaded.  Therefore,
   the situation when the simulator is started is that all DS units are
   "connected to the controller but not ready," whereas all DA units are "not
   connected to the bus."  This eliminates the overhead of sending HP-IB
   messages to unused units.

   In tabular form, the simulator responses are:

      Enabled  Loaded  Attached    DS (MAC)      DA (ICD)
      -------  ------  --------  ------------  ------------
         N       N        N      disconnected  disconnected
         N       N        Y           --            --
         N       Y        N           --            --
         N       Y        Y           --            --
         Y       N        N        unloaded    disconnected
         Y       N        Y        unloaded      unloaded
         Y       Y        N           --            --
         Y       Y        Y         ready         ready

   The unspecified responses are illegal conditions; for example, the simulator
   does not allow an attached unit to be disabled.


   Implementation notes:

    1. To conform exactly to the MAC responses would have required intercepting
       the SET <unit> DISABLED/ENABLED commands in order to clear or set the unit
       accepting bits.  However, short of intercepting the all SET commands with
       a custom command table, there is no way to ensure that unit enables are
       observed.  Adding ENABLED and DISABLED to the modifiers table and
       specifying a validation routine works for the DISABLED case but not the
       ENABLED case -- set_unit_enbdis returns SCPE_UDIS before calling the
       validation routine.

/* Boot an Amigo disc drive.

   The ICD disc bootstrap program is loaded from the HP 12992H Boot Loader ROM
   into memory, the I/O instructions are configured for the interface card's
   select code, and the program is run to boot from the specified unit.  The
   loader supports booting the disc at bus address 0 only.  Before execution,
   the S register is automatically set as follows:

     15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
     ------  ------  ----------------------   -------------   -----
     ROM #    0   1       select code           reserved      head

   The boot routine sets bits 15-6 of the S register to appropriate values.
   Bits 5-3 and 1-0 retain their original values, so S should be set before
   booting.  These bits are typically set to 0, although bit 5 is set for an RTE
   reconfiguration boot, and bits 1-0 may be set if booting from a head other
   than 0 is desired.

/* Load or unload a unit's heads.

   The heads are automatically loaded when a unit is attached and unloaded when
   a unit is detached.  While a unit is attached, the heads may be manually
   unloaded; this yields a "not ready" status if the unit is accessed.  An
   unloaded drive may be manually loaded, returning the unit to "ready" status.

   The ICD controller sets Drive Attention status when the heads unload and also
   asserts a parallel poll response if the heads unload while in idle state 2
   (i.e., after an End command).


   Implementation notes:

    1. The 13365 manual says on page 28 that Drive Attention status is
       "Generated whenever...the drive unloads and the controller is in Idle
       State 2 or 3."  However, the ICD diagnostic tests for Drive Attention
       status on head unload immediately after the Request Status command that
       completes the previous step, which leaves the controller in idle state 1.

       Moreover, the diagnostic does NOT check for Drive Attention status if the
       Amigo ID is 2 (MAC controller).  But the 12745 manual says on page 3-7
       that the status is returned if "...Drive becomes not ready (heads
       unload)" with no mention of controller state.

       It appears as though the diagnostic test is exactly backward.  However,
       we match the diagnostic expectation below.

/* Accept a data byte from the bus.

   The indicated unit is offered a byte that has been sourced to the bus.  The
   routine returns TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether or not it accepted the
   byte.

   Commands from the bus may be universal (applying to all acceptors) or
   addressed (applying only to those acceptors that have been addressed to
   listen).  Data bytes are accepted only if the unit has been addressed to
   listen.  As we are called for a data transfer or an addressed command only if
   we are currently listening, the only bytes that we do not accept are primary
   talk or listen commands directed to another address, or secondary commands
   when we are not addressed to listen.

   This routine handles the HP-IB protocol.  The type of byte passed is
   determined by the state of the ATN signal and, if ATN is asserted, by the
   high-order bits of the value.  Most of the work involves decoding secondary
   commands and their associated data parameters.  The interface state is
   changed as needed to track the command protocol.  The states processed in
   this routine are:

   opcode_wait
   ===========

     A Receive Disc Command secondary has been received, and the interface is
     waiting for the opcode that should follow.

   parameter_wait
   ==============

     A disc opcode or interface command has been received, and the interface is
     waiting for a parameter byte that should follow.

   write_wait
   ==========

     A disc write command has been received, and the interface is waiting for
     the Receive Write Data secondary that should follow.

   read_wait
   =========

     A disc read command has been received, and the interface is waiting for the
     Send Read Data secondary that should follow.

   status_wait
   ===========

     A disc status command has been received, and the interface is waiting for
     the Send Disc Status secondary that should follow.

   write_xfer
   ==========

     A disc write is in progress, and the interface is waiting for a data byte
     that should follow.

   error_sink
   ==========

     A disc write has terminated with an error, and the interface is waiting to
     absorb all of the remaining data bytes of the transfer.


   Disc commands and parameters are assembled in the sector buffer before being
   passed to the disc library to start the command.  Once the command is
   started, the interface state is set either to execute the command or to wait
   for the receipt of a data transfer secondary before executing, depending on
   the command.

   Two disc command protocol errors are detected.  First, an Illegal Opcode is
   identified during the check for the expected number of disc command
   parameters.  This allows us to sink an arbitrary number of parameter bytes.
   Second, an I/O Program Error occurs if an unsupported secondary is received
   or the HP-IB sequence is incorrect.  The latter occurs if a command has the
   wrong number of parameters or a secondary data transfer sequence is invalid.

   Disc commands that require data transfers (e.g., Read, Write, Request Status)
   involve a pair of secondaries.  The first transmits the command, and the
   second transmits or receives the data.  If one occurs without the other, an
   I/O Program Error occurs.

   A secondary or command that generates an I/O Program Error is always ignored.
   Error recovery is as follows:

    - An unsupported talk secondary sends a single data byte tagged with EOI.

    - An unsupported listen secondary accepts and discards any accompanying data
      bytes until EOI is asserted or an Unlisten is received.

    - A supported command with too few parameter bytes or for which the last
      parameter byte is not tagged with EOI (before unlisten) does nothing.

    - A supported command with too many parameter bytes accepts and discards
      excess parameter bytes until EOI is asserted or an Unlisten is received.

    - A read or status command that is not followed by a Send Read Data or a
      Send Disc Status secondary does nothing.  The unexpected secondary is
      executed normally.

    - A write command that is not followed by a Receive Write Data secondary
      does nothing.  The unexpected secondary is executed normally.

    - A Send Read Data or a Send Disc Status secondary that is not preceded by a
      read or status command sends a single data byte tagged with EOI.

    - A Receive Write Data secondary that is not preceded by a write command
      accepts and discards data bytes until EOI is asserted or an Unlisten is
      received.

   The Amigo command sequence does not provide a byte count for disc read and
   write commands, so the controller continues to source or accept data bytes
   until the device is unaddressed.  Normally, this is done by an Unlisten or
   Untalk.  However, per IEEE-488, a listening device may be unaddressed by IFC,
   by an Unlisten, or by addressing the device to talk, and a talking device may
   be unaddressed by IFC, by addressing another device to talk (or no device via
   Untalk), or by addressing the device to listen.  Therefore, we must keep
   track of whether the unit stopped talking or listening, and if it has, we
   check for command termination.

   If the controller is unaddressed in the middle of a sector transfer, the read
   or write must be terminated cleanly to ensure that the disc image is
   coherent.  It is also permissible to untalk the controller before all of the
   requested status bytes are returned.

   In addition, the controller has no way to inform the host that an error has
   occurred that prevents the command from continuing.  For example, if a data
   error is encountered while reading or a protected track is encountered while
   writing, the controller must still source or sink data bytes until the
   command is terminated by the host.  The controller handles read errors by
   sourcing a single data byte tagged with EOI and write errors by sinking data
   bytes until EOI is seen or the unit is unaddressed.

   Therefore, if the unit is unaddressed while a read, write, or status command
   is transferring data, the unit service must be scheduled to end the current
   command.  Unaddressing while an error condition is present merely terminates
   the source or sink operation.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The 13365 manual does not indicate that the controller responds to
       Universal Clear, but the 12992H loader ROM issues this primary and
       expects the controller to initialize.

    2. It is not necessary to check for listening when processing addressed
       commands, as only listeners are called by the bus source.

/* Start a command with parameters.

   A command that has been waiting for all of its parameters to be received is
   now ready to start.  If this is a disc command, call the disc library to
   validate the parameters and, if they are OK, to start the command.  Status
   commands return the status values in the sector buffer and the number of
   words that were returned in the buffer length, which we convert to a byte
   count.

   If the disc command was accepted, the library returns a pointer to the unit
   to be scheduled.  For an ICD controller, the unit is always the one currently
   addressed, so we simply test if the return is not NULL.  If it isn't, then we
   set the next interface state as determined by the command that is executing.
   For example, a Read command sets the interface to read_wait status in order
   to wait until the accompanying Send Read Data secondary is received.

   If the return is NULL, then the command was rejected, so we set DSJ = 1 and
   leave the interface state in parameter_wait; the controller status will have
   been set to the reason for the rejection.

   If the next interface state is command_exec, then the disc command is ready
   for execution, and we return TRUE to schedule the unit service.  Otherwise,
   we return FALSE, and the appropriate action will be taken by the caller.

   For all other commands, execution begins as soon as the correct parameters
   are received, so we set command_exec state and return TRUE.  (Only Amigo
   Clear and Initiate Self Test require parameters, so they will be the only
   other commands that must be started here.)


   Implementation notes:

    1. As the ICD implementation does not need to differentiate between unit and
       controller commands, the return value from the dl_start_command routine
       is not used other than as an indication of success or failure.

/* Complete an in-process command abort.

   Errors in the command protocol begin an abort sequence that may involve
   sourcing or sinking bytes to allow the sequence to complete as expected by
   the CPU.  Unaddressing the unit terminates the aborted command.

   If an abort is in progress, and the interface is not idle, the end-of-data
   indication is set, and the disc service routine is called directly to process
   the completion of the abort.  The service routine will terminate the
   error_source or error_sink state cleanly and then idle the interface.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The test for an abort-in-progress is made before calling this routine.
       This saves the call overhead for the most common case, which is the card
       is being unaddressed after normal command completion.
