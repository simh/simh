   The HP 12845B Line Printer Interface Kit connects the 2607A, 2613A, 2617A,
   and 2618A printers to the HP 1000 family.  Each subsystem consists of an
   interface card employing differential line drivers and receivers, an
   interconnecting cable, and an HP 2607A (200 lines per minute), HP 2613 (300
   lpm), HP 2617 (600 lpm), or HP 2618 (1250 lpm) line printer.  The interface
   is supported by RTE driver DVA12 and DOS driver DVR12.  The interface
   supports DMA transfers, but the OS drivers do not use them.

   Two versions of this interface were produced.  The 12845A interface is
   designed to connect the HP 2610 and HP 2614 line printers.  The 12845B
   interface supports these two printers, plus the 2607, 2613, 2617, 2618, 2619,
   and 2631.  The "A" card does not permit DMA transfers, whereas the "B" card
   does.  The latter provides a configuration jumper, "STR", that selectively
   delays the strobe to the printer.  This is needed because DMA output cycles
   assert IOO and STC in same cycle, i.e., data is coincident with strobe, and
   this is insufficient for the 2607, 2610 and 2614.  Placing "STR" in position
   2 delays the strobe for one cycle.  DMA with other printers and all non-DMA
   operation uses "STR" in position 1.

   The 12845B outputs seven data bits to the printer plus these control signals:

     - Master Clear
     - Paper Instruction
     - Strobe

   Master Clear is asserted by CRS and clears the line printer buffer and aborts
   a paper advance in progress (except on the 2613).  It does not abort a print
   cycle in progress.  Paper Instruction asserts to indicate that the data lines
   contain a format word that commands a print-and-slew operation.  Strobe
   asserts to indicate that the signals on the data lines are valid.

   The interface receives these status signals from the printer:

     - Demand
     - Buffer Ready
     - Printer Ready
     - Printer Online
     - VFU Channel 9
     - VFU Channel 12

   Demand denies when the printer is busy and asserts to indicate that the
   printer has completed the requested operation.  Denial causes Strobe to
   deny.  Assertion sets the flag buffer flip-flop if Buffer Ready is also
   asserted.

   Buffer Ready denies when the printer is printing and asserts when printing
   completes and the print buffer may be loaded.  Buffer Ready and Demand are
   reflected in bit 0 of the status word provided to the CPU.  The 2607 has
   Buffer Ready permanently asserted (it is double-buffered and can accept
   characters while printing).

   Printer Ready asserts when power is applied and no fault condition exists.
   It is inverted (i.e., to indicate Not Ready) and presented as bit 14 of the
   status word.

   Printer Online asserts while the printer is online.  It is reflected in bit
   15 of the status word.

   VFU Channel 9 and VFU channel 12 assert when the paper is positioned at the
   print line corresponding to holes punched in the associated VFU tape
   locations.  They are presented as status word bits 13 and 12, respectively.

   The interface status word contains these values for the 2613/17/18 printers:

     Value   Meaning
     ------  -------------------------------------
     140001  Power off or cable disconnected
     100001  Power on, paper loaded, printer ready
     100000  Power on, paper loaded, printer busy
     000000  Power on, print button up
     040000  Power on, paper out or drum gate open

   The 2607 status word values are:

     Value   Meaning
     ------  -----------------------------------------------------
     140001  Power off or cable disconnected
     100001  Power on, paper loaded, printer ready
     100000  Power on, paper loaded, printer busy
     000000  Power on, paper out or print button up or platen open

   The simulator supports a single line printer.  The supported printers are
   configured with Option 001, which provides a 128 (2607) or 96 (2613/17/18)
   character set.  Two output modes are provided: an expanded mode that is
   suitable for retaining printer output as a text file, and a compact mode that
   is suitable for sending the printer output to a host-connected physical
   printer.  An 8-channel (2607) or 12-channel (2613/17/18) Vertical Format Unit
   is supported, and custom VFU tape images may be loaded from properly
   formatted host-system text files.

   The printer supports realistic and optimized (fast) timing modes.  Realistic
   timing attempts to model the print buffer load and print-and-space operation
   delays inherent in the physical hardware.  For example, in REALTIME mode,
   output of longer lines takes more time than output of shorter lines, and
   spacing six lines takes approximately six times longer than spacing one line.
   In FASTTIME mode, all timings are reduced to be "just long enough" to satisfy
   the software driver requirements.

   Attaching the LPT device simulates loading paper into the printer.  Detaching
   simulates removing or running out of paper.

   The printer may be set offline or online.  It may also be powered off or on
   to accommodate the interface diagnostic.  A diagnostic mode is provided to
   install the 02613-80002 or 02618-80002 VFU tape.  This is the standard VFU
   tape with channel 10 punched for line 59 (BOF - 1), channel 11 punched for
   line 66 (TOF - 1), and channel 12 punched for line 1 (TOF).

   When the ON/OFFLINE button on the printer is pressed, the printer will not go
   offline (i.e., deny the ONLINE signal) if there are characters in the print
   buffer.  Instead, the offline condition is held off until an internal "allow
   offline" signal asserts.  This occurs when the print buffer is empty and the
   print cycle is inactive.

   When a "paper out" condition occurs, the 2613/17/18 printers will go offline
   at the end of the current line.  The 2607 printer waits until the top-of-form
   is seen before going offline.  This has implications for the SET OFFLINE and
   DETACH commands if they are issued while the print buffer contains data or
   the printer unit is busy executing a print action.

   The SET LPT OFFLINE and DETACH LPT commands check for data in the print
   buffer or a print operation in progress.  If either condition is true, they
   set their respective deferred-action flags and display "Command not
   completed."  A SHOW LPT will show that the device is still online and
   attached.  Once simulation is resumed and the print operation completes, the
   printer is set offline or detached as requested.  No console message reports
   this, as it is assumed that the executing program will detect the condition
   and report accordingly.  A subsequent SHOW LPT will indicate the new status.

   A SET LPT ONLINE command when a deferred-action flag is set simply clears the
   flag, which cancels the pending offline or detach condition.

   A RESET LPT command also clears the deferred-action flags and so clears any
   pending offline or detach.  However, it also clears the print buffer and
   terminates any print action in progress, so a SET LPT OFFLINE or DETACH LPT
   will succeed if issued subsequently.

   An immediate detach may be forced by the DETACH -F LPT command.  This
   simulates physically removing the paper from the printer and succeeds
   regardless of the current printer state.


   The interface responds to I/O instructions as follows:

   Output Data Word format (OTA and OTB):

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The printers use only seven data bits, so the MSB of each byte is ignored.
   If the printer's line length is exceeded during write operations, the
   buffered line will be printed, the paper will be advanced one line, and the
   buffer will be cleared to accept the character causing the overflow.

   The format commands recognized by the printers are:

     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -- slew 0 lines (suppress spacing) after printing *
          ...
     0 0 0 1 1 1 1 -- slew 15 lines after printing

     0 0 1 0 0 0 0 -- slew 16 lines after printing **
          ...
     0 1 1 1 1 1 1 -- slew 63 lines after printing **

      * slew 1 line on the 2607A, which cannot suppress printing.
     ** available only on the 2610A and 2614A

   and:

     1 x x 0 0 0 0 -- slew to VFU channel 1 after printing
          ...
     1 x x 0 1 1 1 -- slew to VFU channel 8 after printing

     1 x x 1 0 0 0 -- slew to VFU channel 9 after printing *
          ...
     1 x x 1 0 1 1 -- slew to VFU channel 12 after printing *

     * available only on the 2613A, 2617A, and 2618A


   Input Data Word format (LIA, LIB, MIA, and MIB):

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     L = Online
     R = Not ready
     V = VFU channel 9
     U = VFU channel 12
     D = Demand


   Implementation notes:

     1. The hardware STR jumper that delays the strobe for one cycle for DMA
        compatibility with the 2607, 2610, and 2614 printers is not implemented,
        as it is irrelevant for simulation.

     2. The hardware switch S1 (the NORMAL/TEST switch) that allows printer
        testing without a diagnostic program is not implemented.

/* Delay properties table.

   To support the realistic timing mode, the delay properties table contains
   timing specifications for the supported printers.  The times represent the
   delays for mechanical and electronic operations.  Delay values are in event
   tick counts; macros are used to convert from times to ticks.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Although all of the printers operate more slowly with a 96/128-character
       set installed than with a 64-character set, the times reflect the smaller
       set size.  Also, some models provide different print rates, depending on
       how many and/or which characters are printed.  These variations are not
       simulated.

   The line printer interface is installed on the I/O bus and receives I/O
   commands from the CPU and DMA/DCPC channels.  In simulation, the asserted
   signals on the bus are represented as bits in the inbound signal_set.  Each
   signal is processed sequentially in numerical order.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The simulation implements the 12845B Series 1506 interface that inhibits
       STROBE if the printer is offline.

    2. In hardware, an STC signal sets both the Control flip-flop and the
       Information Ready flip-flop.  The latter asserts STROBE to the printer,
       which denies DEMAND in response.  The trailing edge of DEMAND clears the
       Information Ready flip-flop and denies STROBE.  In simulation, STC sets
       the Control flip-flop and calls the device service routine to begin the
       print operation.  This is equivalent to STROBE asserting, then DEMAND
       denying, then STROBE denying.  The Information Ready flip-flop is not
       simulated, as it effectively sets and clears within one CPU instruction.

/* Service the printer.

   The printer transfer service is called to output a character to the printer
   buffer or to output a format command that causes the buffered line to be
   printed with specified paper movement.

   In hardware, the interface places a character or format code on the lower
   seven data out lines and asserts STROBE to the printer.  The printer responds
   by denying DEMAND.  The interface then denies STROBE and waits for the
   printer to reassert DEMAND to indicate that the buffer load or print
   operation is complete.

   In simulation, this service routine is called twice for each transfer.  It is
   called immediately when STROBE is asserted with DEMAND asserted and then
   after a variable delay with STROBE denied.  In response to the former call,
   the routine denies DEMAND and STROBE, loads the character buffer or prints
   the buffered line, and then sets up an event delay corresponding to the
   operation performed.  In response to the latter call, the routine asserts
   DEMAND and then clears the event delay time, so that the routine will be
   reentered immediately when STROBE is asserted again.  DEMAND assertion also
   sets the flag buffer flip-flop.

   If a SET LPT OFFLINE or DETACH LPT command simulating an out-of-paper
   condition is given, the printer will not honor the command immediately if
   data exists in the print buffer or the printer is currently printing a line.
   In this case, the action is deferred until this service routine is entered to
   complete a print operation.  At that point, the printer goes offline with
   DEMAND denied.  This leaves the transfer handshake incomplete.  When the
   printer is placed back online, DEMAND is asserted to conclude the handshake.

   Control word bit 15 determines whether the code on the data out lines is
   interpreted as a character (0) or a format command (1).  If there is room in
   the print buffer, the character is loaded.  If not, then depending on the
   model, the printer either discards the character or automatically prints the
   buffer contents, advances the paper one line, and stores the new character in
   the empty buffer.  If a control character is sent but the printer cannot
   print it, a space is loaded in its place.

   A format command causes the current buffer to be printed, and then the paper
   is advanced by a prescribed amount.  Two output modes are provided: compact
   and expanded.

   In compact mode, a printed line is terminated by a CR LF pair, but subsequent
   line spacing is performed by LFs alone.  Also, a top-of-form request will
   emit a FF character instead of the number of LFs required to reach the top of
   the next form, and overprinting is handled by emitting a lone CR at the end
   of the line.  This mode is used when the printer output file will be sent to
   a physical printer connected to the host.

   In expanded mode, paper advance is handled solely by emitting CR LF pairs.
   Overprinting is handled by merging characters in the buffer.  This mode is
   used where the printer output file will be saved or manipulated as a text
   file.

   The format commands recognized by the printer are:

     0 x x 0 0 0 0 -- slew 0 lines (suppress spacing) after printing
          ...
     0 x x 1 1 1 1 -- slew 15 lines after printing

   and:

     1 x x 0 0 0 0 -- slew to VFU channel 1 after printing
          ...
     1 x x 1 0 1 1 -- slew to VFU channel 12 after printing

   A command to slew to a VFU channel that is not punched or to a VFU channel
   other than those defined for the printer will cause a tape fault, and the
   printer will go offline; setting the printer back online will clear the
   fault.  Otherwise, LFs or a FF (compact mode) or CR LF pairs (expanded mode)
   will be added to the buffer to advance the paper the required number of
   lines.

   Not all printers can overprint.  A request to suppress spacing on a printer
   that cannot (e.g., the HP 2607) is treated as a request for single spacing.

   If the stream write fails, an error message is displayed on the simulation
   console, a printer alarm condition is set (which takes the printer offline),
   and SCPE_IOERR is returned to cause a simulation stop to give the user the
   opportunity to fix the problem.  Simulation may then be resumed, either with
   the printer set back online if the problem is fixed, or with the printer
   remaining offline if the problem is uncorrectable.


   Implementation notes:

    1. When a paper-out condition is detected, the 2607 printer goes offline
       only when the next top-of-form is reached.  The 2613/17/18 printers go
       offline as soon as the current line completes.

    2. A printer going offline, either via a user action or by a paper-out
       condition, does not complete the last handshake.  Instead, DEMAND remains
       denied, so the interface flag never sets.  Typically, this causes an I/O
       timeout in the OS driver, which issues a CLC and downs the device.  When
       the printer is set back online, DEMAND asserts, which sets the flag.
       However, the CLC has cleared the control flip-flop, so no interrupt is
       generated.  When the device is upped, the incomplete request is reissued;
       this results in either a duplicate printed line or a duplicate paper
       movement.

    3. Because attached files are opened in binary mode, newline translation
       (i.e., from LF to CR LF) is not performed by the host system.  Therefore,
       we write explicit CR LF pairs to end lines, even in compact mode, as
       required for fidelity to HP peripherals.  If bare LFs are used by the
       host system, the printer output file must be postprocessed to remove the
       CRs.

    4. Overprinting in expanded mode is simulated by merging the lines in the
       buffer.  A format command to suppress spacing resets the buffer index but
       saves the previous buffer length as a "high water mark" that will be
       extended if the overlaying line is longer.  This process may be repeated
       as many times as desired before issuing a format command that prints the
       buffer.

       When overlaying characters, if a space overlays a printing character, a
       printing character overlays a space, or a printing character overlays
       itself, then the printing character is retained.  Otherwise, an
       "overprint character" (which defaults to DEL, but can be changed by the
       user) replaces the character in the buffer.

    5. Printers that support 12-channel VFUs treat the VFU format command as
       modulo 16.  Printers that support 8-channel VFUs treat the command as
       modulo 8.

    6. As a convenience to the user, the printer output stream is flushed when a
       TOF operation is performed.  This permits inspection of the output file
       from the SCP command prompt while output is ongoing.

    7. The user may examine the TFAULT and PFAULT registers to determine why the
       printer went offline.

    8. Explicit tests for lowercase and control characters are much faster and
       are used rather than calls to "islower" and "iscntrl", which must
       consider the current locale.

    9. This routine will not be entered with the printer unit unattached.  The
       printer must be online (and therefore attached) before an STC will
       schedule the service, and "lp_detach" will not detach the unit if it is
       busy unless it is forced (and, in the latter case, "lp_detach" will
       cancel the service event).  So protection against "uptr->fileref" being
       NULL is not required.

   existing file content.  In all cases, the paper is positioned at the top of
   the form.


   Implementation notes:

    1. If we are called during a RESTORE command to reattach a file previously
       attached when the simulation was SAVEd, the device status and file
       position are not altered.  This is because SIMH 4.x restores the register
       contents before reattaching, while 3.x reattaches before restoring the
       registers.

    2. The pointer to the appropriate event delay times is set in case we are
       being called during a RESTORE command (the assignment is redundant
       otherwise).

/* Detach the printer image file.

   The specified file is detached from the indicated unit.  This is the
   simulation equivalent of running out of paper or unloading the paper from the
   printer.  The out-of-paper condition cause a paper fault alarm, and the
   printer goes offline.

   When the printer runs out of paper, it will not go offline until characters
   present in the buffer are printed and paper motion stops.  In addition, the
   2607 printer waits until the paper reaches the top-of-form position before
   going offline.

   In simulation, entering a DETACH LPT command while the printer is busy will
   defer the file detach until print operations reach the top of the next form
   (2607) or until the current print operation completes (2613/17/18).  An
   immediate detach may be forced by adding the -F switch to the DETACH command.
   This simulates physically removing the paper from the printer and succeeds
   regardless of the current printer state.


   Implementation notes:

    1. During simulator shutdown, this routine is called for the printer unit.
       The printer must be detached, even if a detach has been deferred, to
       ensure that the file is closed properly.  We do this in response to a
       detach request with the SIM_SW_SHUT switch present.

    2. The DETACH ALL command will fail if any detach routine returns a status
       other than SCPE_OK.  Because a deferred detach is not fatal, we must
       return SCPE_OK, but we still want to print a warning to the user.

    3. Because the 2607 only paper faults at TOF, we must explicitly set the
       offline_pending flag, as lp_set_alarm may not have been called.

   if the printer is going online.  This simulates pressing the ON/OFFLINE
   button on the printer.  The unit must be attached (i.e., paper must be
   loaded), before the printer may be set online or offline.

   If the printer is being taken offline, the buffer is checked to see if any
   characters are present.  If they are, or if the printer unit is currently
   scheduled (i.e., executing a print operation), the offline request is
   deferred until printing completes, and the routine returns "Command not
   complete" status to inform the user.  Otherwise, the unit is set offline and
   DEMAND is denied to indicate that the printer is not ready.

   If the printer is being put online and paper is present, the unit is set
   online, and any paper or tape fault present is cleared.  DEMAND is asserted
   to indicate that the printer is ready to accept characters.  If the flag
   flip-flop is clear, then DEMAND assertion sets the flag buffer flip-flop.

   As a special case, a detach (out-of-paper condition) or offline request that
   has been deferred until printing completes may be cancelled by setting the
   printer online.  No other action is taken, because the printer has never
   transitioned to the offline state.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Although a deferred offline request is not fatal, we return SCPE_INCOMP

/* Load the VFU.

   The printer VFU is loaded either with a custom tape image stored in the file
   associated with the stream "vf" or with the standard 66-line tape if the
   stream is NULL.  The "uptr" parameter points to the printer unit.

   The standard VFU tape (02607-80024 for the 8-channel HP 2607 and 02613-80001
   for the 12-channel HP 2613, 2617, and 2618) defines the channels as:

     Chan  Description
     ----  --------------
       1   Top of form
       2   Bottom of form
       3   Single space
       4   Double space
       5   Triple space
       6   Half page
       7   Quarter page
       8   Sixth page
       9   Bottom of form

   ...with channels 10-12 uncommitted.

   If the DIAGNOSTIC mode is set, the standard tape is replaced with the
   diagnostic tape (02613-80002 for the 2613 and 2617 or 02618-80002 for the
   2618).  This tape extends the standard VFU tape above as follows:

     Chan  Description
     ----  ----------------------------------------
      10   Line before the bottom of form (line 59)
      11   Line before the top of form (line 66)
      12   Top of form (line 1)

   The 2607 diagnostic mode uses the standard 8-channel tape.

   A custom tape file starts with a VFU definition line and then contains one
   channel-definition line for each line of the form.  The number of lines
   establishes the form length.  Channel 1 must be dedicated to the top-of-form,
   but the other channels may be defined as desired.

   A semicolon appearing anywhere on a line begins a comment, and the semicolon
   and all following characters are ignored.  Zero-length lines, including lines
   beginning with a semicolon, are ignored.

   Note that a line containing one or more blanks is not a zero-length line, so,
   for example, the line " ; a comment starting in column 2" is not ignored.

   The first (non-ignored) line in the file is a VFU definition line of this
   exact form:

     VFU=<punch characters>,<no-punch character>{,<title>}

   ...where:

     Parameter           Description
     ------------------  -------------------------------------------------------
     punch characters    a string of one or more characters used interchangeably
                         to represent a punched location

     no-punch character  a single character representing a non-punched location

     title               an optional descriptive string printed by the SHOW LPT
                         VFU command ("Custom VFU" is used by default)

   If the "VFU" line is missing or not of the correct form, then "Format error"
   status is returned, and the VFU tape is not changed.

   The remaining (non-ignored) lines define the channels punched for each line
   of the printed form.  The line format consists of a sequence of punch,
   no-punch, and "other" characters in channel order.  Each punch or no-punch
   character defines a channel state, starting with channel 1 and proceeding
   left-to-right until all channels for the VFU are defined; if the line
   terminates before all channels are defined, the remaining channels are set to
   the no-punch state.  Any "other" characters (i.e., neither a punch character
   nor a no-punch character) are ignored and may be used freely to delineate the
   tape channels.

   Examples using the standard 66-line tape definition for an 8-channel VFU:


     ; the VFU definition                 |   VFU=1234578,  ; no-punch is a ' '
     VFU=1,0,a binary tape image          |
                                          |   1             ; top of form
     ; the channel definitions            |     345         ; form line 1
                                          |     3           ; form line 2
     10111111   ; top of form             |     34          ; form line 3
     00100000   ; single space            |     3 5         ; form line 4
     0011       ; channels 5-8 no-punch   |     34          ; form line 5
                                          |
     -------------------------------------+-------------------------------------
                                          |
     VFU=X,-,blanks are "others"          |   VFU=TO,.,brackets are "others"
                                          |   ; 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
     X  -  X  X  X  X  X  X   ; line 1    |   ;--- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
     -  -  X  -  -  -  -  -   ; line 2    |    [T]  .  [O] [O] [O] [O] [O] [O]
     -  -  X  X  -  -  -  -   ; line 3    |     .   .  [O]  .   .   .   .   .
                                          |     .   .  [O] [O]  .   .   .   .


   On entry, the "vf" parameter determines whether the standard tape or a custom
   tape is to be loaded.  If "vf" is NULL, a standard 66-line tape is generated
   and stored in the tape buffer.  Otherwise, a custom tape file is read,
   parsed, and assembled VFU entries are stored in the tape buffer.  After
   generation or a successful tape load, the buffer is copied to the VFU array,
   the form length is set, the current line is reset to the top-of-form, and the
   state of VFU channels 9 and 12 are set into the device status.


   Implementation notes:

    1. VFU array entries 1-n correspond to form print lines 1-n.  Entry 0 is the
       logical OR of all of the other entries and is used during VFU format
       command processing to determine if a punch is present somewhere in a
       given channel.

    2. In DIAGNOSTIC mode, the 2613/17/18 diagnostic tape is generated
       unconditionally, as the 2607 will use only the eight standard channels.

/* Read a line from the VFU file.

   This routine reads a line from the VFU tape image file designated by the file
   stream parameter "vf", stores the data in the string buffer pointed to by
   "line" and whose size is given by "size", and returns the length of that
   string.  Comments are stripped from lines that are read, and the routine
   continues to read until a non-zero-length line is found.  If the end of the
   file was reached, the return value is 0.  If a file error occurred, the
   return value is -1.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The routine assumes that the file was opened in text mode, so that
       automatic CRLF-to-LF conversion is done if needed.  This simplifies
       the end-of-line removal.
