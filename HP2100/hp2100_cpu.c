   Hewlett-Packard sold the HP 21xx/1000 family of real-time computers from 1966
   through 2000.  There are three major divisions within this family: the 21xx
   core-memory machines, the 1000 (originally 21MX) M/E/F-Series semiconductor-
   memory machines, and the 1000 L/A-Series machines.  All machines are 16-bit
   accumulator-oriented CISC machines running the same base instruction set.  A
   wide range of operating systems run on these machines, from a simple 4K word
   paper-tape-based monitor to a megaword multi-user, multiprogramming disc-
   based system and a multi-user time-shared BASIC system.

   This implementation is a simulator for the 2114, 2115, 2116, 2100, and 1000
   M/E/F-Series machines.  A large variety of CPU options, device interface
   cards, and peripherals are provided.  High-speed I/O transfers are performed
   by Direct Memory Access and Dual-Channel Port Controller options.  This
   simulator does not model the 1000 L/A-Series machines.

   All of the machines support a 15-bit logical address space, addressing a
   maximum of 32 K words, divided into 1K-word pages.  Memory-referencing
   instructions in the base set can directly address the 1024 words of the base
   page (page 0) or the 1024 words of the current page (the page containing the
   instruction).  The instructions in the extended set directly address the
   32768 words in the full logical address space.  The A and B accumulators may
   be addressed as logical addresses 0 and 1, respectively.

   Peripheral devices are connected to the CPU by interface cards installed in
   the I/O card cages present in the CPU and optional I/O extender chassis. Each
   slot in the card cage is assigned an address, called a select code, that may
   be referenced by I/O instructions in the base set.  Select codes range from 0
   to 77 octal, with the first eight select codes reserved for the system,
   providing connections for 56 possible interfaces.

   The 211x machines use a hardwired processor providing 70 basic instructions
   and up to 32K of core memory.  The base instruction set is divided into the
   Memory Reference Group, the Shift-Rotate Group, the Alter-Skip Group, and the
   I/O Group.  SRG instruction words may contain from one to four suboperation
   codes that are executed from left-to-right, and ASG instruction words may
   contain from one to eight suboperations.  An optional Extended Arithmetic
   Unit may be added to the 2115 and 2116 that provides hardware multiply and
   divide, double-load and -store, and double-word shift and rotate
   instructions.

   The 2100 machine uses a microprogrammed processor that provides the 80
   instructions of the base set and the EAU as standard equipment.  Optional
   floating-point microcode adds six two-word single-precision instructions.
   User microprogramming is also supported.  When used as part of an HP 2000
   Time-Shared BASIC system, the CPU designated as the I/O processor may be
   equipped with microcode implementing 18 additional OS accelerator
   instructions.

   The 1000 M/E-Series machines also use microprogrammed processors and extend
   the 2100 instruction set with two new index registers, X and Y, and a new
   Extended Instruction Group consisting of 32 index-register instructions and
   10 word-and-byte-manipulation instructions.  The six 2100 floating-point
   instructions are also standard.  The 1000 F-Series adds a hardware
   floating-point processor with 18 new triple- and quad-word instructions.  A
   number of new optional microcode extensions are available with the
   M/E/F-Series.

   1000 CPUs offer the optional Dynamic Mapping System, which provides memory
   mapping on a page-by-page basis.  The 5-bit page number of a logical memory
   address selects one of 32 ten-bit map registers containing physical page
   numbers.  The ten-bit page number combined with the ten-bit page offset
   yields a 20-bit physical address capable of accessing a location in a
   one-megaword memory.  DMS provides separate maps for system and user
   programs, as well as for the two DCPC channels, and includes microcode that
   implements the 38 Dynamic Mapping Instructions used to manipulate the mapping
   system.

   Optional memory protection is accomplished by dividing the logical address
   space into protected and unprotected parts.  When protection is enabled, any
   attempt to write below the fence separating the two parts is inhibited, and
   an interrupt to the operating system occurs, which aborts the offending user
   program.  If the DMS option is enabled as well, protection is enhanced by
   specifying read and write permissions on a page-by-page basis.

   A note on terminology: the 1000 series of computers was originally called the
   21MX at introduction.  The 21MX (occasionally, 21MXM) corresponds to the 1000
   M-Series, and the 21MXE (occasionally, 21XE) corresponds to the 1000
   E-Series.  The model numbers were changed before the introduction of the 1000
   F-Series, although some internal HP documentation refers to this machine as
   the 21MXF.

   The terms MEM (Memory Expansion Module), MEU (Memory Expansion Unit), DMI
   (Dynamic Mapping Instructions), and DMS (Dynamic Mapping System) are used
   somewhat interchangeably to refer to the logical-to-physical memory address
   translation option provided on the 1000-Series.  DMS consists of the MEM card
   (12731A) and the DMI firmware (13307A).  However, MEM and MEU have been used
   interchangeably to refer to the mapping card, as have DMI and DMS to refer to
   the firmware instructions.


   These CPU hardware registers are present in all machines:

      E      1    extend flag (carry out)
      O      1    overflow flag

   The 1000 Series adds these CPU hardware registers:

     Name  Width  Description
     ----  -----  ----------------------------------------------
      X     16    index register
      Y     16    index register

   The data types supported by the base instruction set are:

     - 8-bit unsigned byte
     - 16-bit unsigned integer
     - 16-bit two's-complement integer
     - 32-bit two's-complement integer
     - 32-bit two's-complement floating point

   Multi-word values are stored in memory with the most-significant words in the
   lowest addresses.  Bytes are stored in memory with the most-significant byte
   in the upper half of the 16-bit word and the least-significant byte in the
   lower half.

   The instruction set is fairly irregular -- a legacy of its original
   implementation in hardware in the 2116 and the accretion of microprogrammed
   instructions in the 2100 and 1000 CPUs.  Initially, there were five base-set
   instruction groups:

     1. Memory-Reference Group (MRG)
     2. Shift-Rotate Group (SRG)
     3. Alter-Skip Group (ASG)
     4. I/O Group (IOG)
     5. Macroinstruction Group (MAC)

   All of the instructions added after the 2116 are in the Macroinstruction
   Group.

   The 2116 offered two hardware options that extended the instruction set.  The
   first is the 12579A Extended Arithmetic Unit.  The second is the 2152A
   Floating Point Processor, which is interfaced through, and therefore
   requires, the EAU.  The EAU adds 10 instructions including integer multiply
   and divide and double-word loads, stores, shifts, and rotates.  The FPP adds
   30 floating-point arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential
   instructions.  (The 2116 FFP is not simulated.)

   The base set groups are decoded from bits 15-12 and 10, as follows:

     15  14-12  10  Group  Address Ranges
     --  -----  --  -----  -------------------------------
      x   nnn    x   MRG   010000-077777 and 110000-177777
      0   000    0   SRG   000000-001777 and 004000-005777
      0   000    1   ASG   002000-003777 and 006000-007777
      1   000    1   IOG   102000-103777 and 106000-107777
      1   000    0   MAC   100000-101777 and 104000-105777

   Where:

     x = don't care
     n = any combination other than all zeros

   The MAC group is subdivided into the Extended Arithmetic Group (EAG) and the
   User Instruction Group (UIG), based on bits 11, 9, and 8, as follows:

     11   9   8  Group  Address Range
     --  --  --  -----  -------------
      0   0   0  EAG    100000-100377
      0   0   1  EAG    100400-100777
      0   1   0  EAG    101000-101377
      0   1   1  UIG-1  101400-101777
      1   0   0  EAG    104000-104377
      1   0   1  EAG    104400-104777
      1   1   0  UIG-0  105000-105377
      1   1   1  UIG-1  105400-105777

   All of the 2116 FPP instructions are in the UIG sets: 3 use 10144x opcodes
   and the rest use 1050xx and 1054xx opcodes.  The 2100 decodes only UIG-0
   instructions, whereas the 1000s use both UIG sets.  In particular, the
   105740-105777 range is used by the 1000 Extended Instruction Group (EIG),
   which is part of the 1000-Series base set.

   The 21xx and 1000 M/E/F-Series machines do not trap unimplemented
   instructions.  In general, unimplemented EAG instructions cause erroneous
   execution, and unimplemented UIG instructions execute as NOP.  However, there
   are machine-to-machine variations, and some unimplemented instructions
   execute as other, defined instructions.

   The instruction set groups are encoded as follows:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0

   Where:

     I = direct/indirect (0/1)
     R = A/B register (0/1)
     P = base/current page (0/1)

   The "mem ops" are encoded as follows:

     14-11  Mnemonic  Action
     -----  --------  ----------------------------------------
     0010     AND     A = A & M [MA]
     0011     JSB     M [MA] = P, P = MA + 1
     0100     XOR     A = A ^ M [MA]
     0101     JMP     P = MA
     0110     IOR     A = A | M [MA]
     0111     ISZ     M [MA] = M [MA] + 1, skip if M [MA] == 0
     1000     ADA     A = A + M [MA]
     1001     ADB     B = B + M [MA]
     1010     CPA     skip if A != M [MA]
     1011     CPB     skip if B != M [MA]
     1100     LDA     A = M [MA]
     1101     LDB     B = M [MA]
     1110     STA     M [MA] = A
     1111     STB     M [MA] = B

   Bits 15 and 10 encode the type of access, as follows:

     15,10  Access Type            Action
     -----  ---------------------  --------------------------
      0,0   base page direct       MA = I <9:0>
      0,1   current page direct    MA = P <14:0>'I <9:0>
      1,0   base page indirect     MA = M [I <9:0>]
      1,1   current page indirect  MA = M [P <14:10>'I <9:0>]

   An I/O group instruction controls the device specified by the select code.

   start or stop I/O, or read or write data.

   In simulation, I/O devices are modelled by substituting software states for
   I/O backplane signals.  The set of signals generated by I/O instructions and
   DMA cycles is dispatched to the target device for action.  Backplane signals
   are processed sequentially.  For example, the "STC sc,C" instruction
   generates the "set control" and the "clear flag" signals that are processed
   in that order.

   CPU interrupt signals are modelled as three parallel arrays:

     - device request priority as bit vector dev_prl [2] [31..0]
     - device interrupt requests as bit vector dev_irq [2] [31..0]
     - device service requests as bit vector dev_srq [2] [31..0]

   Each array forms a 64-bit vector, with bits 0-31 of the first element
   corresponding to select codes 00-37 octal, and bits 0-31 of the second
   element corresponding to select codes 40-77 octal.

   The HP 21xx/1000 interrupt structure is based on the PRH, PRL, IRQ, and IAK
   signals.  PRH indicates that no higher-priority device is interrupting. PRL
   indicates to lower-priority devices that a given device is not interrupting.
   IRQ indicates that a given device is requesting an interrupt.  IAK indicates
   that the given device's interrupt request is being acknowledged.

   PRH and PRL form a hardware priority chain that extends from interface to
   interface on the backplane.  We model just PRL, as PRH is calculated from the
   PRLs of higher-priority devices.

   Typical I/O devices have a flag, flag buffer, and control flip-flops.  If a
   device's flag, flag buffer, and control bits are set, and the device is the
   highest priority on the interrupt chain, it requests an interrupt by
   asserting IRQ.  When the interrupt is acknowledged with IAK, the flag buffer
   is cleared, preventing further interrupt requests from that device. The
   combination of flag and control set blocks interrupts from lower priority
   devices.

   Service requests are used to trigger the DMA service logic.  Setting the
   device flag typically also sets SRQ, although SRQ may be calculated
   independently.


   The simulator provides three stop conditions related to instruction execution
   that may be enabled with a SET CPU STOP=<stop> command:

     <stop>  Action
     ------  ------------------------------------------
     UNIMPL  stop on an unimplemented instruction
     UNDEF   stop on an undefined instruction
     UNSC    stop on an access to an unused select code
     IOERR   stop on an unreported I/O error

   If an enabled stop condition is detected, execution ceases with the
   instruction pending, and control returns to the SCP prompt.  When simulation
   stops, execution may be resumed in two ways.  If the cause of the stop has
   not been remedied and the stop has not been disabled, resuming execution with
   CONTINUE, STEP, GO, or RUN will cause the stop to occur again.  Alternately,
   specifying the "-B" switch with any of the preceding commands will resume
   execution while bypassing the stop for the current instruction.

   The UNIMPL option stops the simulator if execution is attempted of an
   instruction provided by a firmware option that is not currently installed
   (e.g., a DAD instruction when the double-integer firmware is not installed)
   or of an opcode provided by an installed option but not assigned to an
   instruction (e.g., opcode 105335 from the double-integer firmware).
   Bypassing the stop will execute the instruction as a NOP (no-operation).

   The UNDEF option stops the simulator if execution is attempted of an
   instruction containing a decoded reserved bit pattern other than that defined
   in the Operating and Reference manual for the CPU.  For example, opcodes
   101700 and 105700 are not listed as DMS instructions, but they execute as
   XMM instructions, rather than as NOP.  The intent of this stop is to catch
   instructions containing reserved fields with values that change the meaning
   of those instructions.  Bypassing the stop will decode and execute the
   instruction in the same manner as the selected CPU.

   The UNSC option stops the simulator if an I/O instruction addresses a select
   code that is not assigned to an enabled device (equivalent to an empty
   hardware I/O backplane slot).  Bypassing the stop will read the floating
   S-bus or I/O-bus for LIA/B and MIA/B instructions or do nothing for all other
   instructions.

   The IOERR option stops the simulator if an I/O error condition exists for a
   device that does not report this status to the CPU.  For example, the paper
   tape reader device (PTR) does not report "no tape loaded" status, and the
   processor interconnect device (IPL) does not report "cable disconnected."  In
   both cases, I/O to the device will simply hang with no indication of the
   problem.  Enabling the IOERR option will stop the simulator with an error
   indication for these devices.

   In addition, a simulation stop will occur if an indirect addressing chain
   exceeds the maximum length specified by a SET CPU INDIR=<limit> command.
   Memory addresses may be indirect to indicate that the values point to the
   target addresses rather than contain the target addresses.  The target of an
   indirect address may itself be indirect, and the CPU follows this chain of
   addresses until it finds a direct address.  Indirect addressing is typically
   only one or two levels deep, but if the chain loops back on itself (e.g., if
   an indirect address points at itself), then instruction execution will hang.

   The limit may be set to any number of levels up to 32,768.  This is the
   absolute maximum number of levels that can be created without an infinite
   loop -- each location in memory points to the next one except for the last,
   which contains the target value.  In practice, anything over a few levels
   likely represents a programming error.  The default setting is 16 levels.


   In addition to the CPU, this module simulates the 12578A/12607B/12895A Direct
   Memory Access and 12897B Dual-Channel Port Controller devices (hereafter,
   "DMA").  These controllers permit the CPU to transfer data directly between
   an I/O device and memory on a cycle-stealing basis.  Depending on the CPU,
   the device interface, and main memory speed, DMA is capable of transferring
   data blocks from 1 to 32,768 words in length at rates between 500,000 and
   1,000,000 words per second.  The 2114 supports a single DMA channel.  All
   other CPUs support two DMA channels.

   DMA is programmed by setting three control words via two select codes: 2 and
   6 for channel 1, and 3 and 7 for channel 2.  During simultaneous transfers,
   channel 1 has priority over channel 2.  Otherwise, the channels are
   identical. Channel programming involves setting three control words, as
   follows:

   SC 06 Control Word 1 format:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | S | B | C | -   -   -   -   -   -  -  |  device select code   |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     S = assert STC during each cycle
     B = enable byte packing and unpacking (12578A only)
     C = assert CLC at the end of the block transfer

   SC 02 Control Word 2/3 format:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | D |                  starting memory address                  | word 2
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                      negative word count                      | word 3
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     D = transfer direction is out of/into memory (0/1)

   Control word 2 is stored if the control flip-flop of select code 2 is clear,
   i.e., if the OTA/B is preceded by CLC; control word 3 is stored if the
   flip-flop is set by a preceding STC.

   The 12607B supports 14-bit addresses and 13-bit word counts.  The 12578A
   supports 15-bit addresses and 14-bit word counts.  The 12895A and 12897B
   support 15-bit addresses and 16-bit word counts.

   DMA is started by setting the control flip-flop on select code 6.  DMA
   completion is indicated when the flag flip-flop sets on select code 8, which
   causes an interrupt if enabled.


   This module also simulates the 12581A/12892B Memory Protect devices for the
   2116 and 1000 M/E/F-Series, respectively, and the memory protect feature that
   is standard equipment for the 2100.  MP is addressed via select code 5 and
   provides a fence register that holds the address of the start of unprotected
   memory and a violation register that holds the address of the instruction
   that has caused a memory protect interrupt, as follows:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | 0 |          starting address of unprotected memory           | fence
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | 0 |               violating instruction address               | violation
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   After setting the fence regiater with an OTA 5 or OTB 5 instruction, MP is
   enabled by an STC 5.


   This module also simulates the 12731A Memory Expansion Module for the 1000
   M/E/F-Series machines.  The MEM provides mapping of the 32 1024-word logical
   memory pages into a one-megaword physical memory.  Four separate maps are
   provided: system, user, DCPC port A, and DCPC port B.  The MEM is controlled
   by the associated Dynamic Mapping System instructions and contains status and
   violation registers, as follows:

   MEM Status Register:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | I | M | E | U | P | B |        base page fence address        |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     I = MEM disabled/enabled (0/1) at last interrupt
     M = System/user map (0/1) selected at last interrupt
     E = MEM disabled/enabled (0/1) currently
     U = System/user map (0/1) selected currently
     P = Protected mode disabled/enabled (0/1) currently
     B = Base-page portion mapped (0/1 = above/below the fence)

   MEM Violation Register:

      15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | R | W | B | P | -   -   -   - | S | E | M |    map address    |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     R = Read violation
     W = Write violation
     B = Base-page violation
     P = Privileged instruction violation
     S = ME bus disabled/enabled (0/1) at violation
     E = MEM disabled/enabled (0/1) at violation
     M = System/user map (0/1) selected at violation


   The CPU simulator provides extensive tracing capabilities that may be enabled
   with the SET DEBUG <filename> and SET CPU DEBUG=<trace> commands.  The trace
   options that may be specified are:

     Trace  Action
     -----  -------------------------------------------
     INSTR  trace instructions executed
     DATA   trace memory data accesses
     FETCH  trace memory instruction fetches
     REG    trace registers
     OPND   trace instruction operands
     EXEC   trace matching instruction execution states

   The INSTR option traces instruction executions and interrupts.  Each
   instruction is printed in symbolic form before it is executed.

   The DATA option traces reads from and writes to memory.  Each access is
   classified by its usage type as "data" (using the current or alternate map
   with access protection) or "unprotected" (using a specified map without
   protection).

   The FETCH option traces instruction fetches from memory.  Reads of the
   additional words in a multiword instruction, such as the target address of a
   DLD (double load) instruction, are also classified as fetches.

   The REG option traces register values.  Two sets of registers are printed.
   After executing each instruction, the working registers (A, B, E, O, S, and,
   for 1000 CPUs, X and Y) and the state of the interrupt system (on or off) are
   printed.  After executing an instruction that may alter the Memory Protect or
   Memory Expansion Module state, the MP fence and violation registers, the MEM
   status and violation registers, and the current protection state are printed.

   The OPND option traces operand values.  Some instructions that take memory
   and register operands that are difficult to decode from DATA or REG traces
   present the operand values in a higher-level format.  The operand data and
   value presented are specific to the instruction; see the instruction executor
   comments for details.

   The EXEC option traces the execution of instructions that match
   user-specified criteria.  When a match occurs, all CPU trace options are
   turned on for the duration of the execution of the matched instruction.  The
   prior trace settings are restored when a match fails.  This option allows
   detailed tracing of specified instructions while minimizing the log file size
   compared to a full instruction trace.

   The various trace formats are interpreted as follows:

   Implementation notes:

    1. The simulator is fast enough, compared to the run-time of the longest
       instructions, for interruptibility not to matter.  However, the HP
       diagnostics explicitly test interruptibility in the EIS and DMS
       instructions and in long indirect address chains.  Accordingly, the
       simulator does "just enough" to pass these tests.  In particular, if an
       interrupt is pending but deferred at the beginning of an interruptible
       instruction, the interrupt is taken at the appropriate point; but there
       is no testing for new interrupts during execution (that is, the event
       timer is not called).

   Implementation notes:

    1. The 21MX monikers are deprecated in favor of the 1000 designations.  See
       the "HP 1000 Series Naming History" on the back inside cover of the
       Technical Reference Handbook.

    2. Each CPU option requires three modifiers.  The two regular modifiers
       control the setting and printing of the option, while the extended
       modifier controls clearing the option.  The latter is necessary because
       the option must be checked before confirming the change, and so the
       option value must be passed to the validation routine.

/* Simulation stop list.

   The simulator can be configured to detect certain machine instruction
   conditions and stop execution when one of them occurs.  Stops may be enabled
   or disabled individually with these commands:

     SET CPU STOP=<option>[;<option]
     SET CPU NOSTOP=<option>[;<option]

   The CPU stop table is used to parse the commands and set the appropriate
   variables to enable or disable the stops.


   Implementation notes:

    1. To avoid the testing of stop conditions at run time, they are implemented
       by setting individual stop status variables either to the appropriate
       stop code (if enabled) or to SCPE_OK (if disabled).  This allows the
       affected routines to return the status value unconditionally and cause
       either a simulator stop or continued execution without a run-time test.

    2. SCPE_IOERR is not actually returned for unreported I/O errors.  Instead,
       it is simply a flag that a stop code specific to the detected error
       should be returned.

    3. To permit stops to be bypassed for one instruction execution, routines
       use the STOP macro to return the value of the applicable stop variable
       ANDed with the complement of the value of the "cpu_ss_inhibit" variable.
       The latter is set in the instruction prelude to SS_INHIBIT (i.e., all
       ones) if a bypass is requested or to SCPE_OK (i.e., all zeros) if not,
       and is reset to SCPE_OK after each instruction execution.  The effect is
       that SCPE_OK is returned instead of a simulator stop if a stop condition
       occurs when a bypass is specified.  This action depends on the value of
       SCPE_OK being zero (which is guaranteed).

/* CPU global SCP support routines */


/* Execute CPU instructions.

   This is the instruction decode routine for the HP 21xx/1000 simulator.  It is
   called from the simulator control program (SCP) to execute instructions in
   simulated memory, starting at the simulated program counter.  It runs until
   the status to be returned is set to a value other than SCPE_OK.

   On entry, P points to the instruction to execute, and the "sim_switches"
   global contains any command-line switches included with the run command.  On
   exit, P points at the next instruction to execute.

   Execution is divided into four phases.

   First, the instruction prelude configures the simulation state to resume
   execution.  This involves verifying that there are no device conflicts (e.g.,
   two devices with the same select code) and initializing the I/O state.  These
   actions accommodate reconfiguration of the I/O device settings and program
   counter while the simulator was stopped.  The prelude also responds to one
   command-line switch: if "-B" is specified, the current set of simulation stop
   conditions is bypassed for the first instruction executed.

   Second, the memory protect abort mechanism is set up.  MP aborts utilize the
   "setjmp/longjmp" mechanism to transfer control out of the instruction
   executors without returning through the call stack.  This allows an
   instruction to be aborted part-way through execution when continuation is
   impossible due to a memory access violation.

   Third, the instruction execution loop decodes instructions and calls the
   individual executors in turn until a condition occurs that prevents further
   execution.  Examples of such conditions include execution of a HLT
   instruction, a user stop request (CTRL+E) from the simulation console, a
   recoverable device error (such as an improperly formatted tape image), a
   user-specified breakpoint, and a simulation stop condition (such as execution
   of an unimplemented instruction).  The execution loop also polls for I/O
   events and device interrupts, and runs DMA channel cycles.  During
   instruction execution, the IR register contains the currently executing
   instruction, and the P register points to the memory location containing the
   next instruction.

   Fourth, the instruction postlude updates the simulation state in preparation
   for returning to the SCP command prompt.  Devices that maintain an internal
   state different from their external state, such as the MEM status and
   violation registers, are updated so that their internal and external states
   are fully consistent.  This ensures that the state visible to the user during
   the simulation stop is correct.  It also ensures that the program counter
   points correctly at the next instruction to execute upon resumption.


   In hardware, if the Memory Protect accessory is installed and enabled, I/O
   operations to select codes other than 01 are prohibited.  Also, in
   combination with the MPCK micro-order, MP validates the M-register contents
   (memory address) against the memory protect fence.  If a violation occurs, an
   I/O instruction or memory write is inhibited, and a memory read returns
   invalid data.

   In simulation, an instruction executor that detects an MP violation calls the
   MP_ABORT macro, passing the violation address as the parameter.  This
   executes a "longjmp" to the abort handler, which is outside of and precedes
   the instruction execution loop.  The value passed to "longjmp" is a 32-bit
   integer containing the logical address of the instruction causing the
   violation.  MP_ABORT should only be called if "mp_control" is SET, as aborts
   do not occur if MP is turned off.

   An MP interrupt (SC 05) is qualified by "ion" but not by "ion_defer".  If the
   interrupt system is off when an MP violation is detected, the violating
   instruction will be aborted, even though no interrupt occurs.  In this case,
   neither the flag nor the flag buffer are set, and EVR is not cleared.


   The instruction execution loop starts by checking for event timer expiration.
   If one occurs, the associated event service routine is called, and if it was
   successful, the DMA service requests and interrupt requests are recalculated.

   DMA cycles are requested by an I/O card asserting its SRQ signal.  If a DMA
   channel is programmed to respond to that card's select code, a DMA cycle will
   be initiated.  A DMA cycle consists of a memory cycle and an I/O cycle.
   These cycles are synchronized with the control processor on the 21xx CPUs. On
   the 1000s, memory cycles are asynchronous, while I/O cycles are synchronous.
   Memory cycle time is about 40% of the I/O cycle time.

   With properly designed interface cards, DMA is capable of taking consecutive
   I/O cycles.  On all machines except the 1000 M-Series, a DMA cycle freezes
   the CPU for the duration of the cycle.  On the M-Series, a DMA cycle freezes
   the CPU if it attempts an I/O cycle (including IAK) or a directly-interfering
   memory cycle.  An interleaved memory cycle is allowed.  Otherwise, the
   control processor is allowed to run.  Therefore, during consecutive DMA
   cycles, the M-Series CPU will run until an IOG instruction is attempted,
   whereas the other CPUs will freeze completely.

   All DMA cards except the 12607B provide two independent channels.  If both
   channels are active simultaneously, channel 1 has priority for I/O cycles
   over channel 2.

   Most I/O cards assert SRQ no more than 50% of the time.  A few buffered
   cards, such as the 12821A and 13175A Disc Interfaces, are capable of
   asserting SRQ continuously while filling or emptying the buffer.  If SRQ for
   channel 1 is asserted continuously when both channels are active, then no
   channel 2 cycles will occur until channel 1 completes.

   Interrupt recognition is controlled by three state variables: "ion",
   "ion_defer", and "intrq".  "ion" corresponds to the INTSYS flip-flop in the
   1000 CPU, "ion_defer" corresponds to the INTEN flip-flop, and "intrq"
   corresponds to the NRMINT flip-flop.  STF 00 and CLF 00 set and clear INTSYS,
   turning the interrupt system on and off.  Micro-orders ION and IOFF set and
   clear INTEN, deferring or allowing certain interrupts.  An IRQ signal from a
   device, qualified by the corresponding PRL signal, will set NRMINT to request
   a normal interrupt; an IOFF or IAK will clear it.

   Under simulation, "ion" is controlled by STF/CLF 00.  "ion_defer" is set or
   cleared as appropriate by the individual instruction simulators.  "intrq" is
   set to the successfully interrupting device's select code, or to zero if
   there is no qualifying interrupt request.

   Presuming PRL is set to allow priority to an interrupting device:

    1. Power fail (SC 04) may interrupt if "ion_defer" is clear; this is not
       conditional on "ion" being set.

    2. Memory protect (SC 05) may interrupt if "ion" is set; this is not
       conditional on "ion_defer" being clear.

    3. Parity error (SC 05) may interrupt always; this is not conditional on
       "ion" being set or "ion_defer" being clear.

    4. All other devices (SC 06 and up) may interrupt if "ion" is set and
       "ion_defer" is clear.

   Qualification with "ion" is performed by "calc_int", except for case 2, which
   is qualified by the MP abort handler above (because qualification occurs on
   the MP card, rather than in the CPU).  Therefore, we need only qualify by
   "ion_defer" here.

   At instruction fetch time, a pending interrupt request will be deferred if
   the previous instruction was a JMP indirect, JSB indirect, STC, CLC, STF,
   CLF, or was executing from an interrupt trap cell. In addition, the following
   instructions will cause deferral on the 1000 series: SFS, SFC, JRS, DJP, DJS,
   SJP, SJS, UJP, and UJS.

   On the HP 1000, the request is always deferred until after the current
   instruction completes.  On the 21xx, the request is deferred unless the
   current instruction is an MRG instruction other than JMP or JMP,I or JSB,I.
   Note that for the 21xx, SFS and SFC are not included in the deferral
   criteria.


   When a status other than SCPE_OK is returned from an instruction executor or
   event service routine, the instruction execution loop exits into the
   instruction postlude.  The set of debug trace flags is restored if it had
   been changed by an active execution trace or idle trace suppression.  This
   ensures that the simulation stop does not exit with the flags set improperly.
   If the simulation stopped for a programmed halt, the 21xx binary loader area
   is protected in case it had been unprotected to run the loader.  The DMS
   status and violation registers and the program counter queue pointer are
   updated to present the proper values to the user interface.  The default
   breakpoint type is updated to reflect the current MEU state (disabled, system
   map enabled, or user map enabled).  Finally, the P register is reset if the
   current instruction is to be reexecuted on reentry (for example, on an
   unimplemented instruction stop).


   Implementation notes:

    1. While the Microsoft VC++ "setjmp" documentation says, "All variables
       (except register variables) accessible to the routine receiving control
       contain the values they had when longjmp was called," the ISO C99
       standard says, "All accessible objects have values...as of the time the
       longjmp function was called, except that the values of objects of
       automatic storage duration that are local to the function containing the
       invocation of the corresponding setjmp macro that do not have
       volatile-qualified type and have been changed between the setjmp
       invocation and longjmp call are indeterminate."

       Therefore, the "exec_save" and "idle_save" variables are marked static
       to ensure that they are reloaded after a longjmp caused by a memory
       protect abort (they are not marked volatile to save redundant reloads
       within the instruction execution loop).  Also, "status" and "exec_test"
       are set before reentering the instruction loop after an abort.  This is
       done solely to reassure the compiler that the values are not clobbered,
       even though in both cases the values are reestablished after an abort
       before they are used.

    2. The protected lower bound address for the JSB instruction depends on the
       W5 jumper setting.  If W5 is in, then the lower bound is 2, allowing JSBs
       to the A and B registers.  If W5 is out, then the lower bound is 0, just
       as with JMP.  The protected lower bound is set during the instruction
       prelude and tested during JSB address validation.

    3. The -P switch is removed from the set of command line switches to ensure
       that internal calls to the device reset routines are not interpreted as
       "power-on" resets.

    4. The "longjmp" handler is used both for MP and MEM violations.  The MEV
       flip-flop will be clear for the former and set for the latter.  The MEV
       violation register will be updated by "dms_upd_vr" only if the call is
       NOT for an MEM violation; if it is, then the register has already been
       set and should not be disturbed.

    5. For an MP/MEM abort, the violation address is passed via "longjmp" to
       enable the MEM violation register to be updated.  The "longjmp" routine
       will not pass a value of 0; it is converted internally to 1.  This is OK,
       because only the page number of the address value is used, and locations
       0 and 1 are both on page 0.

    6. A CPU freeze is simulated by skipping instruction execution during the
       current loop cycle.

    7. If both DMA channels have SRQ asserted, priority is simulated by skipping
       the channel 2 cycle if channel 1's SRQ is still asserted at the end of
       its cycle.  If it is not, then channel 2 steals the next cycle from the
       CPU.

    8. The 1000 M-Series allows some CPU processing concurrently with
       continuous DMA cycles, whereas all other CPUs freeze.  The processor
       freezes if an I/O cycle is attempted, including an interrupt
       acknowledgement.  Because some microcode extensions (e.g., Access IOP,
       RTE-6/VM OS) perform I/O cycles, advance detection of I/O cycles is
       difficult.  Therefore, we freeze all processing for the M-Series as well.

    9. EXEC tracing is active when exec_save is non-zero.  "exec_save" saves the
       current state of the trace flags when an EXEC trace match occurs.  For
       this to happen, at least TRACE_EXEC must be set, so "exec_save" will be
       set non-zero when a match is active.

   10. The execution trace (TRACE_EXEC) match test is performed in two parts to
       display the register values both before and after the instruction
       execution.  Consequently, the enable test is done before the register
       trace, and the disable test is done after.

   11. A simulation stop bypass is inactivated after the first instruction
       execution by the expedient of setting the stop inhibition mask to the
       execution status result.  This must be SCPE_OK (i.e., zero) for execution
       to continue, which removes the stop inhibition.  If a non-zero status
       value is returned, then the inhibition mask will be set improperly, but
       that is irrelevant, as execution will stop in this case.

/* Install an initial binary loader into memory.

   This routine copies the initial binary loader contained in "rom" to the last
   64 words of main memory, limited by a 32K memory size.  If "dev" contains a
   select code of an I/O interface (i.e., select code 10 or above), this routine
   will configure the I/O instructions in the IBL to the supplied select code.
   On exit, P will be set to point at the first word of the loader, and S will
   be altered as directed by the "sr_clear" and "sr_set" masks.

   If I/O configuration is requested, each instruction in the IBL is examined as
   it is copied to memory.  If the instruction is a non-HLT I/O instruction
   referencing a select code >= 10, the select code will be reset by subtracting
   10 and adding the value of the select code supplied in the "dev" parameter.
   This permits configuration of IBLs that address two- or three-card
   interfaces.  Passing a "dev" value of 0 will inhibit configuration.

   As an example, passing a "dev" value of 24 octal will alter these
   instructions as follows:

         IBL      Configured
     Instruction  Instruction  Note
     -----------  -----------  ------------------------------
       OTA 10       OTA 24     Normal configuration
       LIA 11       LIA 25     Second card configuration
       STC  6       STC  6     DCPC configuration not changed
       HLT 11       HLT 11     Halt instruction not changed

   If configuration is performed, the routine will also alter the next-to-last
   word unconditionally as above.  This word is assumed to contain a DCPC
   control word; it is configured to reference the supplied select code.

   Finally, the routine sets the last word to the two's-complement of the
   starting address of the IBL.  This value may be used by the loader to check
   that it will not be overwritten by loaded data.

   If memory protect is enabled, and the instruction is not in a trap cell, then

   jumper W7 (SEL1) is in, then all other I/O instructions are legal; if W7 is
   out, then only I/O instructions to select code 1 are legal, and I/O to other
   select codes will cause a violation.

   If the instruction is allowed, then the I/O signal corresponding to the
   instruction is determined, and the state of the interrupt deferral flag is
   set.  The signal is then dispatched to the device simulator indicated by the
   target select code.  The return value is split into status and data values,
   with the latter containing the SKF signal state or data to be returned in the
   A or B registers.


   Implementation notes:

    1. If the H/C (hold/clear flag) bit is set, then the ioCLF signal is added
       to the base signal set derived from the I/O instruction.

    2. ioNONE is dispatched for HLT instructions because although HLT does not
       assert any backplane signals, the H/C bit may be set.  If it is, then the
       result will be to dispatch ioCLF.

    3. Device simulators return either ioSKF or ioNONE in response to an SFC or
       SFS signal.  ioSKF means that the instruction should skip.  Because
       device simulators return the "data" parameter value by default, we
       initialize that parameter to ioNONE to ensure that a simulator that does
       not implement SFC or SFS does not skip, which is the correct action for
       an interface that does not drive the SKF signal.

    4. STF/CLF and STC/CLC share sub-opcode values and must be further decoded
       by the state of instruction register bits 9 and 11, respectively.

    5. We return NOTE_IOG for normal status instead of SCPE_OK to request that
       interrupts be recalculated at the end of the instruction (execution of
       the I/O group instructions can change the interrupt priority chain).  We
       do this in preference to calling the recalculation routines directly, as
       some extended firmware instructions call this routine multiple times, and
       there is no point in recalculating until all calls are complete.

/* Calculate interrupt requests.

   The interrupt request (IRQ) of the highest-priority device for which all
   higher-priority PRL bits are set is granted.  That is, there must be an
   unbroken chain of priority to a device requesting an interrupt for that
   request to be granted.

   A device sets its IRQ bit to request an interrupt, and it clears its PRL bit
   to prevent lower-priority devices from interrupting.  IRQ is cleared by an
   interrupt acknowledge (IAK) signal.  PRL generally remains low while a
   device's interrupt service routine is executing to prevent preemption.

   IRQ and PRL indicate one of four possible states for a device:

     IRQ  PRL  Device state
     ---  ---  ----------------------
      0    1   Not interrupting
      1    0   Interrupt requested
      0    0   Interrupt acknowledged
      1    1   (not allowed)

   Note that PRL must be dropped when requesting an interrupt (IRQ set).  This
   is a hardware requirement of the 1000 series.  The IRQ lines from the
   backplane are not priority encoded.  Instead, the PRL chain expresses the
   priority by allowing only one IRQ line to be active at a time.  This allows a
   simple pull-down encoding of the CIR inputs.

   The end of priority chain is marked by the highest-priority (lowest-order)
   bit that is clear.  The device corresponding to that bit is the only device
   that may interrupt (a higher priority device that had IRQ set would also have
   had PRL set, which is a state violation).  We calculate a priority mask by
   ANDing the complement of the PRL bits with an increment of the PRL bits.
   Only the lowest-order bit will differ.  For example:

     dev_prl     :  ...1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1   (PRL denied for SC 06 and 11)

     dev_prl + 1 :  ...1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ~dev_prl     :  ...0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
     ANDed value :  ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0   (break is at SC 06)

   The interrupt requests are then ANDed with the priority mask to determine if
   a request is pending:

     pri mask    :  ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0   (allowed interrupt source)
     dev_irq     :  ...0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0   (devices requesting interrupts)
     ANDed value :  ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0   (request to grant)

   The select code corresponding to the granted request is then returned to the
   caller.

   If ION is clear, only power fail (SC 04) and parity error (SC 05) are
   eligible to interrupt (memory protect shares SC 05, but qualification occurs
   in the MP abort handler, so if SC 05 is interrupting when ION is clear, it
   must be a parity error interrupt).

/* Resolve a indirect address.

   This routine resolves a supplied memory address into a direct address by
   following an indirect chain, if any.  On entry, "MA" contains the address to
   resolve, and "irq" is non-zero if an interrupt is currently pending.  On
   exit, the variable pointed to by "addr" is set to the direct address, and
   SCPE_OK is returned.  If an interrupt is pending and permitted, NOTE_INDINT
   is returned to abort the instruction, and the variable indicated by "addr" is
   unchanged.

   Logical memory addresses are 15 bits wide, providing direct access to a 32K
   logical address space.  Addresses may also be indirect, with bit 15 (the MSB)
   serving as the direct/indirect indicator.  An indirect address may point at
   either a direct or indirect address.  In the latter case, the chain is
   followed until a direct address is obtained.

   Indirect addressing has implications for interrupt handling.  Normally,
   interrupts are checked at each level of indirection, and if one is pending,
   the CPU will abort execution of the instruction and then service the
   interrupt.  On return from the interrupt handler, the instruction will be
   restarted.

   However, the JMP indirect and JSB indirect instructions hold off interrupts
   until completion of the instruction, including complete resolution of the
   indirect chain.  If the chain is unresolvable (i.e., it points to itself, as
   in the instruction sequence JMP *+1,I and DEF *,I), then interrupts are held
   off forever.

   To prevent a user program from freezing a protected OS with an infinite
   indirect chain, and to permit real-time interrupts to be handled while
   resolving a long indirect chain, the Memory Protect accessory counts indirect
   levels during address resolution and will reenable interrupt recognition
   after the third level.  Operating systems that run without MP installed are
   subject to freezing as above, but those employing MP will be able to regain
   control from an infinite indirect chain.

   In simulation, the SET CPU INDIR=<limit> command sets the maximum number of
   levels; the default is 16.  If the level is exceeded during address
   resolution, the simulator will stop.  The maximum limit is 32768, which is
   the maximum possible address chain without an infinite loop, but an indirect
   chain over a few levels deep almost certainly represents a programming error.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Virtually all valid indirect references are one level deep, so we
       optimize for this case.  Also, we protect against entry with a direct
       address by simply returning the address, but the overhead can be saved by
       calling this routine only for indirect addresses.

    2. The 12892B Memory Protect accessory jumper W6 ("INT") controls whether
       held off pending interrupts are serviced immediately (jumper removed) or
       after three levels of indirection (jumper installed).  If the jumper is
       removed, MP must be enabled (control flip-flop set) for the interrupt
       hold off to be overridden.

       The jumper state need not be checked here, however, because this routine
       can be entered with an interrupt pending ("irq" non-zero) only if
       "ion_defer" and "check_deferral" are both true.  If either is false, the
       pending interrupt would have been serviced before calling the instruction
       executor that is calling this routine to resolve its address.  For
       "check_deferral" to return TRUE, then the INT jumper must be installed or
       the MP control flip-flop must be clear.

    3. When employing the indirect counter, the hardware clears a pending
       interrupt deferral after the third level of indirection and aborts the
       instruction after the fourth.

    4. The JRS, DJP, DJS, SJP, SJS, UJP, and UJS instructions also hold off
       interrupts for three indirect levels, but they count levels internally
       and do not depend on the presence of the MP accessory to reenable
       interrupt recognition.  However, DMS requires MP, so simulation uses the
       MP indirect counter for these instructions as well.

    5. In hardware, it is possible to execute an instruction with an infinite
       indirect loop (e.g., JMP *+1,I and DEF *,I).  If MP is not installed,
       this freezes the CPU with interrupts disabled until HALT is pressed.  In
       simulation, the instruction executes until the indirect limit is reached,
       whereupon the simulator stops with "Indirect address loop" status.
       Modelling the hardware CPU freeze would be difficult, as the simulation
       console would have to be polled locally to watch for CTRL+E (the
       simulation equivalent of the CPU front panel HALT button).

/* Read a word from memory.

   Read and return a word from memory at the indicated logical address.  On
   entry, "dptr" points to the DEVICE structure of the device requesting access,
   "classification" is the type of access requested, and "address" is the offset
   into the 32K logical address space implied by the classification.

   If memory expansion is enabled, the logical address is mapped into a physical
   memory location; the map used is determined by the access classification.
   The current map (user or system), alternate map (the map not currently
   selected), or an explicit map (system, user, DCPC port A, or port B) may be
   requested.  Read protection is enabled for current or alternate map access
   and disabled for the others.  If memory expansion is disabled or not present,
   the logical address directly accesses the first 32K of memory.

   The memory protect (MP) and memory expansion module (MEM) accessories provide
   a protected mode that guards against improper accesses by user programs.
   They may be enabled or disabled independently, although protection requires
   that both be enabled.  MEM checks that read protection rules on the target
   page are compatible with the access desired.  If the check fails, and MP is
   enabled, then the request is aborted.

   The 1000 family maps memory location 0 to the A-register and location 1 to
   the B-register.  CPU reads of these locations return the A- or B-register
   values, while DCPC reads access physical memory locations 0 and 1 instead.


   Implementation notes:

/* Write a word to memory.

   Write a word to memory at the indicated logical address.  On entry, "dptr"
   points to the DEVICE structure of the device requesting access,
   "classification" is the type of access requested, "address" is the offset
   into the 32K logical address space implied by the classification, and
   "value" is the value to write.

   If memory expansion is enabled, the logical address is mapped into a physical
   memory location; the map used is determined by the access classification.
   The current map (user or system), alternate map (the map not currently
   selected), or an explicit map (system, user, DCPC port A, or port B) may be
   requested.  Write protection is enabled for current or alternate map access
   and disabled for the others.  If memory expansion is disabled or not present,
   the logical address directly accesses the first 32K of memory.

   The memory protect (MP) and memory expansion module (MEM) accessories provide
   a protected mode that guards against improper accesses by user programs.
   They may be enabled or disabled independently, although protection requires
   that both be enabled.  MP checks that memory writes do not fall below the
   Memory Protect Fence Register (MPFR) value, and MEM checks that write
   protection rules on the target page are compatible with the access desired.
   If either check fails, and MP is enabled, then the request is aborted (so, to
   pass, a page must be writable AND the target must be above the MP fence).  In
   addition, a MEM write violation will occur if MP is enabled and the alternate
   map is selected, regardless of the page protection.

   The 1000 family maps memory location 0 to the A-register and location 1 to
   the B-register.  CPU writes to these locations store the values into the A or
   B register, while DCPC writes access physical memory locations 0 and 1
   instead.  MP uses a lower bound of 2 for memory writes, allowing unrestricted
   access to the A and B registers.


   Implementation notes:

    1. A write beyond the limit of physical memory is a no-operation.

    2. When the alternate map is enabled, writes are permitted only in the
       unprotected mode, regardless of page protections or the MP fence setting.
       This behavior is not mentioned in the MEM documentation, but it is tested by
       the MEM diagnostic and is evident from the MEM schematic.  Referring to
       Sheet 2 in the ERD, gates U125 and U127 provide this logic:

         WTV = MPCNDB * MAPON * (WPRO + ALTMAP)

       The ALTMAP signal is generated by the not-Q output of flip-flop U117,
       which toggles on control signal -CL3 assertion (generated by the MESP
       microorder) to select the alternate map.  Therefore, a write violation is
       indicated whenever a memory protect check occurs while the MEM is enabled
       and either the page is write-protected or the alternate map is selected.

       The hardware reference manuals that contain descriptions of those DMS
       instructions that write to the alternate map (e.g., MBI) say, "This
       instruction will always cause a MEM violation when executed in the
       protected mode and no bytes [or words] will be transferred."  However,
       they do not state that a write violation will be indicated, nor does the
       description of the write violation state that this is a potential cause.

/* Memory protect and DMS validation for jumps.

   Jumps are a special case of write validation.  The target address is treated
   as a write, even when no physical write takes place, so jumping to a
   write-protected page causes a MEM violation.  In addition, a MEM violation is
   indicated if the jump is to the unmapped portion of the base page.  Finally,
   jumping to a location under the memory-protect fence causes an MP violation.

   Because the MP and MEM hardware works in parallel, all three violations may
   exist concurrently.  For example, a JMP to the unmapped portion of the base
   page that is write protected and under the MP fence will indicate a
   base-page, write, and MP violation, whereas a JMP to the mapped portion will
   indicate a write and MP violation (BPV is inhibited by the MEBEN signal).  If
   MEM and MP violations occur concurrently, the MEM violation takes precedence,
   as the SFS and SFC instructions test the MEV flip-flop.

   The lower bound of protected memory is passed in the "plb" argument.  This
   must be either 0 or 2.  All violations are qualified by the MPCND signal,
   which responds to the lower bound.  Therefore, if the lower bound is 2, and
   if the part below the base-page fence is unmapped, or if the base page is

/* CPU (SC 0) I/O signal handler.

   I/O instructions for select code 0 manipulate the interrupt system.  STF and
   CLF turn the interrupt system on and off, and SFS and SFC test the state of
   the interrupt system.  When the interrupt system is off, only power fail and
   parity error interrupts are allowed.

   A PON reset initializes certain CPU registers.  The 1000 series does a
   microcoded memory clear and leaves the T and P registers set as a result.

   Front-panel PRESET performs additional initialization.  We also handle MEM
   preset here.


   Implementation notes:

    1. An IOI signal reads the floating I/O bus (0 on all machines).

    2. A CLC 0 issues CRS to all devices, not CLC.  While most cards react
       identically to CRS and CLC, some do not, e.g., the 12566B when used as an
       I/O diagnostic target.

    3. RTE uses the undocumented SFS 0,C instruction to both test and turn off
       the interrupt system.  This is confirmed in the "RTE-6/VM Technical
       Specifications" manual (HP 92084-90015), section 2.3.1 "Process the
       Interrupt", subsection "A.1 $CIC":

        "Test to see if the interrupt system is on or off.  This is done with
         the SFS 0,C instruction.  In either case, turn it off (the ,C does
         it)."

       ...and in section 5.8, "Parity Error Detection":

        "Because parity error interrupts can occur even when the interrupt
         system is off, the code at $CIC must be able to save the complete
         system status. The major hole in being able to save the complete state
         is in saving the interrupt system state. In order to do this in both
         the 21MX and the 21XE the instruction 103300 was used to both test the
         interrupt system and turn it off."

    4. Select code 0 cannot interrupt, so there is no SIR handler.

   is the simulation equivalent of an initial power-on condition (corresponding
   to PON, POPIO, and CRS signal assertion in the CPU) or a front-panel PRESET
   button press (corresponding to POPIO and CRS assertion).  SCP delivers a
   power-on reset to all devices when the simulator is started.

   If this is the first call after simulator startup, the initial memory array
   is allocated, the default CPU and memory size configuration is set, and the
   SCP-required program counter pointer is set to point to the REG array element
   corresponding to the P register.

   If this is a power-on reset ("RESET -P"), the default Basic Binary Loader is
   installed in protected memory (the upper 64 words of the defined memory
   size).


   Implementation notes:

    1. Setting the sim_PC value at run time accommodates changes in the register
       order automatically.  A fixed setting runs the risk of it not being
       updated if a change in the register order is made.

    2. A power-on reset installs the BBL in 21xx machines.  The IBL copy routine
       sets the last loader word to the two's complement of the loader starting
       address and configures the second-to-last word (nominally the DMA control
       word) to the I/O select code.  For the BBL, the starting address location
       is five locations back, and the DMA control word is not used, so these
       fixups are performed after copying.

/* Set the CPU simulation stop conditions.

   This validation routine is called to configure the set of CPU stop
   conditions.  The "option" parameter is 0 to clear the stops, 1 to set the
   stops, and 2 to set the indirect chain length limit.  "cptr" points to the
   first character of the name of the stop to be cleared or set.  The unit and
   description pointers are not used.

   The routine processes commands of the form:

     SET CPU NOSTOP
     SET CPU NOSTOP=<stopname>[;<stopname>...]
     SET CPU INDIR=<limit>

   The valid <stopname>s are contained in the "cpu_stop" table.  If names are
   not specified, all stop conditions are enabled or disabled.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The maximum indirect limit value is 32K, as an indirect chain cannot
       exceed the logical memory size without being in a loop.

/* Change the CPU memory size.

   This validation routine is called to configure the CPU memory size.  The
   "new_size" parameter is set to the size desired and will be one of the
   discrete sizes supported by the simulator.  The "uptr" parameter points to
   the CPU unit and is used to obtain the CPU model.  The other parameters are
   not used.

   The routine processes commands of the form:

     SET [-F] CPU <memsize>

   If the new memory size is larger than the supported size for the CPU model
   currently selected, the routine returns an error.  If the new size is smaller
   than the previous size, and if the area that would be lost contains non-zero
   data, the user is prompted to confirm that memory should be truncated.  If
   the user denies the request, the change is rejected.  Otherwise, the new size
   is set.  The user may omit the confirmation request and force truncation by
   specifying the "-F" switch on the command line.

   On a 21xx CPU, the last 64 words in memory are reserved for the binary
   loader.  Before changing the memory size, the current loader is copied to the
   shadow RAM to preserve any manual changes that were made.  Then the new
   memory size is set, with the beginning of the loader area set as the first
   word of non-existent memory.

   Finally, non-existent memory is zeroed, so that the mem_read routine does not
   need any special handling for addresses beyond the end of defined memory.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, reads from non-existent memory return zero, and writes are
       ignored.  In simulation, the largest possible memory is instantiated and
       initialized to zero.  Therefore, only writes need to be checked against
       memory size.

    2. On the 21xx machines, doing SET CPU LOADERDISABLE decreases available
       memory size by 64 words.

   For convenience, MP and DMA are typically enabled if available; they may be

   channel (channel 1).  All other models support two channels.

   Validation:
   - Sets standard equipment and convenience features.
   - Changes DMA device name to DCPC if 1000 is selected.
   - Enforces maximum memory allowed (doesn't change otherwise).
   - Disables loader on 21xx machines.


   Implementation notes:

    1. "cpu_configuration" is used by the symbolic examine and deposit routines
       and instruction tracing to determine whether the firmware implementing a
       given opcode is present.  It is a copy of the CPU unit option flags with
       the encoded CPU model decoded into model flag bits.  This allows a simple
       (and fast) AND operation with a firmware feature word to determine
       applicability, saving the multiple masks and comparisons that would
       otherwise be required.

       Additionally, the configuration word has the unit CPU model bits set on
       permanently to permit a base-set feature test for those CPUs that have no
       options currently enabled (at least one non-option bit must be on for the
       test to succeed, and the model bits are not otherwise used).

/* 21xx loader enable/disable function.

   The 21xx CPUs store their initial binary loaders in the last 64 words of
   available memory.  This memory is protected by a LOADER ENABLE switch on the
   front panel.  When the switch is off (disabled), main memory effectively ends
   64 locations earlier, i.e., the loader area is treated as non-existent.
   Because these are core machines, the loader is retained when system power is
   off.

   1000 CPUs do not have a protected loader feature.  Instead, loaders are
   stored in PROMs and are copied into main memory for execution by the IBL
   switch.

   Under simulation, we keep both a total configured memory size (MEMSIZE) and a
   current configured memory size (fwanxm = "first word address of non-existent
   memory").  When the two are equal, the loader is enabled.  When the current
   size is less than the total size, the loader is disabled.

   Disabling the loader copies the last 64 words to a shadow array, zeros the
   corresponding memory, and decreases the last word of addressable memory by
   64.  Enabling the loader reverses this process.

   Disabling may be done manually by user command or automatically when a halt
   instruction is executed.  Enabling occurs only by user command.  This differs
   slightly from actual machine operation, which additionally disables the
   loader when a manual halt is performed.  We do not do this to allow
   breakpoints within and single-stepping through the loaders.

/* Execute a Shift/Rotate Group micro-operation.

   SRG instructions consist of two shift/rotate micro-operations plus a CLE and
   a SLA/SLB micro-op.  This routine implements the shift and rotate operation.

   Each of the two shift/rotate operations has an enable bit that must be set to
   enable the operation.  If the bit is not set, the operation is a NOP, with
   the exception that an ELA/ELB or ERA/ERB operation alters the E register (but
   not the A/B register).  We accommodate this by including the enable/disable
   bit with the three-bit operation code and decode the disabled operations of
   ELA/ELB and ERA/ERB separately from their enabled operations.

   On entry, "value" is the value of the selected accumulator (A/B), and
   "operation" is the micro-op and enable bit.  The routine returns the updated
   accumulator value and modifies the E register as indicated.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The enable bit is located adjacent to the three-bit encoded operation for
       the first shift/rotate micro-op, but it is spaced one bit away from the
       encoded operation for the second micro-op.  It is faster to decode
       separate values for each location rather than move the second enable bit
       adjacent to its encoded operation.  The former imposes no time penalty;
       the jump table for the "switch" statement is simply somewhat larger.

/* Execute one machine instruction.

   This routine executes the CPU instruction present in the IR.  The CPU state
   (registers, memory, interrupt status) is modified as necessary, and the
   routine return SCPE_OK if the instruction executed successfully.  Any other
   status indicates that execution should cease, and control should return to
   the simulator console.  For example, a programmed HALT instruction returns
   STOP_HALT status.

   This routine implements the main instruction dispatcher.  Instructions
   corresponding to the MRG, SRG, and ASG are executed inline.  IOG, EAG, and
   UIG instructions are executed in external handlers.

   The JMP instruction executor handles CPU idling.  The 21xx/1000 CPUs have no
   "wait for interrupt" instruction.  Idling in HP operating systems consists of
   sitting in "idle loops" that end with JMP instructions.  We test for certain
   known patterns when a JMP instruction is executed to decide if the simulator
   should idle.  The recognized patterns are:

     for RTE-6/VM:
      - ISZ <n> / JMP *-1
      - mp_fence = 0
      - XEQT (address 1717B) = 0
      - DMS on with system map enabled
      - RTE verification: TBG (address 1674B) = CLK select code

     for RTE though RTE-IVB:
      - JMP *
      - mp_fence = 0
      - XEQT (address 1717B) = 0
      - DMS on with user map enabled (RTE-III through RTE-IVB only)
      - RTE verification: TBG (address 1674B) = CLK select code

     for DOS through DOS-III:
      - STF 0 / CCA / CCB / JMP *-3
      - DOS verification: A = B = -1, address 40B = -64, address 67B = +64
      - Note that in DOS, the TBG is set to 100 milliseconds

   Idling must not occur if an interrupt is pending.  As mentioned before, the
   CPU will defer pending interrupts when certain instructions are executed.  OS
   interrupt handlers exit via such deferring instructions.  If there is a
   pending interrupt when the OS is otherwise idle, the idle loop will execute
   one instruction before reentering the interrupt handler.  If we call
   sim_idle() in this case, we will lose interrupts.

   Consider the situation in RTE.  Under simulation, the TTY and CLK events are
   co-scheduled, with the CLK expiring one instruction after the TTY.  When the
   TTY interrupts, $CIC in RTE is entered.  One instruction later, the CLK
   expires and posts its interrupt, but it is not immediately handled, because
   the JSB $CIC,I / JMP $CIC0,I / SFS 0,C instruction entry sequence continually
   defers interrupts until the interrupt system is turned off.  When $CIC
   returns via $IRT, one instruction of the idle loop is executed, even though
   the CLK interrupt is still pending, because the UJP instruction used to
   return also defers interrupts.

   If "sim_idle" is called at this point, the simulator will sleep when it
   should be handling the pending CLK interrupt.  When it awakes, TTY expiration
   will be moved forward to the next instruction.  The still-pending CLK
   interrupt will then be recognized, and $CIC will be entered.  But the TTY and
   then the CLK will then expire and attempt to interrupt again, although they
   are deferred by the $CIC entry sequence.  This causes the second CLK
   interrupt to be missed, as processing of the first one is just now being
   started.

   Similarly, at the end of the CLK handling, the TTY interrupt is still
   pending.  When $IRT returns to the idle loop, "sim_idle" would be called
   again, so the TTY and then CLK interrupt a third time.  Because the second
   TTY interrupt is still pending, $CIC is entered, but the third TTY interrupt
   is lost.

   We solve this problem by testing for a pending interrupt before calling
   "sim_idle".  The system isn't really quiescent if it is just about to handle
   an interrupt.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Instruction decoding is based on the HP 1000, which does a 256-way branch
       on the upper eight bits of the instruction, as follows:

         15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  Instruction Group
         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --  ---------------------------------------
          x <-!= 0->  x  x  x  x  memory reference
          0  0  0  0  x  0  x  x  shift/rotate
          0  0  0  0  x  1  x  x  alter/skip
          1  0  0  0  x  1  x  x  I/O
          1  0  0  0  0  0  x  0  extended arithmetic
          1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  divide (decoded as 100400)
          1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  double load (decoded as 104000)
          1  0  0  0  1  0  0  1  double store (decoded as 104400)
          1  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  extended instr group 0 (A/B is set)
          1  0  0  0  x  0  1  1  extended instr group 1 (A/B is ignored)

    2. JSB is tricky.  It is possible to generate both an MP and a DM violation
       simultaneously, as the MP and MEM cards validate in parallel.  Consider a
       JSB to a location under the MP fence and on a write-protected page.  This
       situation must be reported as a DM violation, because it has priority
       (SFS 5 and SFC 5 check only the MEVFF, which sets independently of the MP
       fence violation).  Under simulation, this means that DM violations must
       be checked, and the MEVFF must be set, before an MP abort is taken.  This
       is done by the "mp_dms_jmp" routine.

    3. Although MR (and TR) will be changed by reads of an indirect chain, the
       idle loop JMP will be direct, and so MR will contain the correct value
       for the "idle loop omitted" trace message.

    4. The Alter/Skip Group RSS micro-op reverses the skip sense of the SEZ,
       SSA/SSB, SLA/SLB, and SZA/SZB micro-op tests.  Normally, the instruction
       skips if any test is true.  However, the specific combination of SSA/SSB,
       SLA/SLB, and RSS micro-ops causes a skip if BOTH of the skip cases are
       true, i.e., if both the MSB and LSB of the register value are ones.  We
       handle this as a special case, because without RSS, the instruction skips
       if EITHER the MSB or LSB is zero.  The other reversed skip cases (SEZ,RSS
       and SZA,RSS/SZB,RSS) are independent.

   Execution of certain instructions generally cause a pending interrupt to be

   deferral rules differ for the 21xx vs. the 1000.

   The 1000 always defers until the completion of the instruction following a
   deferring instruction.  The 21xx defers unless the following instruction is
   an MRG instruction other than JMP or JMP,I or JSB,I.  If it is, then the
   deferral is inhibited, i.e., the pending interrupt will be serviced.

   In either case, if the interrupting device is the memory protect card, or if
   the INT jumper is out on the 12892B MP card, then interrupts are not
   deferred.

/* Logical-to-physical address translation for console access.

   This routine translates a logical address interpreted in the context of the
   translation map implied by the specified switch to a physical address.  It is
   called to map addresses when the user is examining or depositing memory.  It
   is also called to restore a saved configuration, although mapping is not used
   for restoration.  All memory protection checks are off for console access.

   Command line switches modify the interpretation of logical addresses as
   follows:

     Switch  Meaning
     ------  --------------------------------------------------
       -N    Use the address directly with no mapping
       -S    If memory expansion is enabled, use the system map
       -U    If memory expansion is enabled, use the user map
       -P    If memory expansion is enabled, use the port A map
       -Q    If memory expansion is enabled, use the port B map

   If no switch is specified, the address is interpreted using the current map
   if memory expansion is enabled; otherwise, the address is not mapped.  If the
   current or specified map is used, then the address must lie within the 32K
   logical address space; if not, then an address larger than the current memory
   size is returned.

/* DMA/DCPC primary (SC 6/7) I/O signal handler.

   The primary DMA control interface and the service select register are
   manipulated through select codes 6 and 7.  Each channel has transfer enable,
   control, flag, and flag buffer flip-flops.  Transfer enable must be set via
   STC to start DMA.  Control is used only to enable the DMA completion
   interrupt; it is set by STC and cleared by CLC.  Flag and flag buffer are set
   at transfer completion to signal an interrupt.  STF may be issued to abort a
   transfer in progress.

   Again, there are hardware differences between the various DMA cards.  The
   12607B (2114) stores only bits 2-0 of the select code and interprets them as
   select codes 10-16 (SRQ17 is not decoded).  The 12578A (2115/16), 12895A
   (2100), and 12897B (1000) support the full range of select codes (10-77
   octal).


   Implementation notes:

     1. An IOI reads the floating S-bus (high on the 1000, low on the 21xx).

     2. The CRS signal on the DMA card resets the secondary (SC 2/3) select
        flip-flops.  Under simulation, ioCRS is dispatched to select codes 6 and
        up, so we reset the flip-flop in our handler.

     3. The 12578A supports byte-sized transfers by setting bit 14.  Bit 14 is
        ignored by all other DMA cards, which support word transfers only.
        Under simulation, we use a byte-packing/unpacking register to hold one
        byte while the other is read or written during the DMA cycle.

/* DMA/DCPC secondary (SC 2/3) I/O signal handler.

   DMA consists of one (12607B) or two (12578A/12895A/12897B) channels.  Each
   channel uses two select codes: 2 and 6 for channel 1, and 3 and 7 for channel
   2.  The lower select codes are used to configure the memory address register
   (control word 2) and the word count register (control word 3).  The upper
   select codes are used to configure the service select register (control word
   1) and to activate and terminate the transfer.

   There are differences in the implementations of the memory address and word
   count registers among the various cards.  The 12607B (2114) supports 14-bit
   addresses and 13-bit word counts.  The 12578A (2115/6) supports 15-bit
   addresses and 14-bit word counts.  The 12895A (2100) and 12897B (1000)
   support 15-bit addresses and 16-bit word counts.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Because the I/O bus floats to zero on 211x computers, an IOI (read word
       count) returns zeros in the unused bit locations, even though the word
       count is a negative value.

    2. Select codes 2 and 3 cannot interrupt, so there is no SIR handler.

   This routine performs one DMA input or output cycle using the indicated DMA
   channel number and DMS map.  When the transfer word count reaches zero, the
   flag is set on the corresponding DMA channel to indicate completion.

   The 12578A card supports byte-packing.  If bit 14 in control word 1 is set,
   each transfer will involve one read/write from memory and two output/input
   operations in order to transfer sequential bytes to/from the device.

   DMA I/O cycles differ from programmed I/O cycles in that multiple I/O control
   backplane signals may be asserted simultaneously.  With programmed I/O, only
   CLF may be asserted with other signals, specifically with STC, CLC, SFS, SFC,
   IOI, or IOO.  With DMA, as many as five signals may be asserted concurrently.

   DMA I/O timing looks like this:

           ------------ Input ------------   ----------- Output ------------
     Sig    Normal Cycle      Last Cycle      Normal Cycle      Last Cycle
     ===   ==============   ==============   ==============   ==============
     IOI   T2-T3            T2-T3
     IOO                                        T3-T4            T3-T4
     STC *    T3                                T3               T3
     CLC *                     T3-T4                             T3-T4
     CLF      T3                                T3               T3
     EDT                          T4                                T4

      * if enabled by control word 1

   Under simulation, this routine dispatches one set of I/O signals per DMA
   cycle to the target device's I/O signal handler.  The signals correspond to
   the table above, except that all signals for a given cycle are concurrent
   (e.g., the last input cycle has IOI, EDT, and optionally CLC asserted, even
   though IOI and EDT are not coincident in hardware).  I/O signal handlers will
   process these signals sequentially, in the order listed above, before
   returning.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The address increment and word count decrement is done only after the I/O
       cycle has completed successfully.  This allows a failed transfer to be
       retried after correcting the I/O error.

/* Memory Protect local SCP support routine declarations */


/* Memory protect/parity error (SC 5) I/O signal handler.

   The memory protect card has a number of non-standard features:

    - CLF and STF affect the parity error enable flip-flop, not the flag
    - SFC and SFS test the memory expansion violation flip-flop, not the flag
    - POPIO clears control, flag, and flag buffer instead of setting the flags
    - CLC does not clear control (the only way to turn off MP is to cause a
      violation)
    - PRL and IRQ are a function of the flag only, not flag and control
    - IAK is used unqualified by IRQ

   The IAK backplane signal is asserted when any interrupt is acknowledged by
   the CPU.  Normally, an interface qualifies IAK with its own IRQ to ensure
   that it responds only to an acknowledgement of its own request.  The MP card
   does this to reset its flag buffer and flag flip-flops, and to reset the
   parity error indication.  However, it also responds to an unqualified IAK
   (i.e., for any interface) as follows:

    - clears the MPV flip-flop
    - clears the indirect counter
    - clears the control flip-flop
    - sets the INTPT flip-flop

   The INTPT flip-flop indicates an occurrence of an interrupt.  If the trap
   cell of the interrupting device contains an I/O instruction that is not a
   HLT, action equivalent to STC 05 is taken, i.e.:

    - sets the control flip-flop
    - set the EVR flip-flop
    - clears the MEV flip-flop
    - clears the PARERR flip-flop

   In other words, an interrupt for any device will disable MP unless the trap
   cell contains an I/O instruction other than a HLT.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Because the card uses IAK unqualified, this routine is called whenever
       any interrupt occurs.  If the MP card itself is not interrupting, the
       select code passed will not be SC 05.  In either case, the trap cell
       instruction is passed in the data portion of the "stat_data" parameter.

    2. The MEV flip-flop records memory expansion (a.k.a. dynamic mapping)
       violations.  It is set when an DM violation is encountered and can be
       tested via SFC/SFS.

    3. MP cannot be turned off in hardware, except by causing a violation.
       Microcode typically does this by executing an IOG micro-order with select
       code /= 1, followed by an IAK to clear the interrupt and a FTCH to clear
       the INTPT flip-flop.  Under simulation, mp_control may be set to CLEAR to
       produce the same effect.

    4. Parity error logic is not implemented.

   This routine is called in the instruction prelude to set up the I/O data

   select code: one of DIB pointers, and the other of DEVICE pointers.  This
   allows fast access to the device interface routine by the I/O instruction
   executors and to the device trace flags, respectively.

   It also sets the interface priority, interrupt request, and service request
   bit vectors from the interface flip-flop values by calling the device
   interface routines.

   Finally, it sets the interrupt deferral table entries for the SFC and SFS
   signals.  These depend on the current CPU model, which may have been changed
   while the simulation was stopped.

/* Device I/O signal dispatcher.

   This routine calls the I/O signal handler of the device corresponding to the
   supplied "select_code" value, passing the "signal_set" and inbound "data"
   values.  The combined status and outbound data value from the handler is
   returned to the caller.

   The 21xx/1000 I/O structure requires that no empty slots exist between
   interface cards.  This is due to the hardware priority chaining (PRH/PRL)
   that is passed from card-to-card.  If it is necessary to leave unused I/O
   slots, HP 12777A Priority Jumper Cards must be installed in them to maintain
   priority continuity.

   Under simulation, every unassigned I/O slot behaves as though a 12777A were
   resident.  In this configuration, I/O instructions addressed to one of these
   slots read the floating bus for LIA/B and MIA/B instructions or do nothing
   for all other instructions.


   Implementation notes:

     1. For select codes < 10 octal, an IOI signal reads the floating S-bus
        (high on the 1000, low on the 21xx).  For select codes >= 10 octal, an
        IOI reads the floating I/O bus (low on all machines).

     2. If the UNSC simulation stop is set, a stop will occur when an unassigned
        device is accessed.  An exception is a CLC 0 instruction, which asserts
        the CRS signal to all I/O devices from select code 6 up.  This is a
        legitimate access and does not cause a stop.
