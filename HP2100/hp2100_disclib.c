   This library provides common functions required by HP disc controllers.  It
   implements the 13037 MAC and 13365 ICD controller command sets used with the
   7905/06/20/25 and 7906H/20H/25H disc drives.

   The library is an adaptation of the code originally written by Bob Supnik
   for the DS simulator.  DS simulates a 13037 controller connected via a 13175
   disc interface to an HP 1000 computer.  To create the library, the functions
   of the controller were separated from the functions of the interface.  This
   allows the library to work with other CPU interfaces, such as the 12821A
   HP-IB disc interface, that use substantially different communication
   protocols.  The library functions implement the controller command set for
   the drive units.  The interface functions handle the transfer of commands and
   data to and from the CPU.

   As a result of this separation, the library does not handle the data transfer
   between the controller and the interface directly.  Instead, data is moved
   between the interface and a sector buffer by the interface simulator, and
   then the buffer is passed to the disc library for reading or writing.  This
   buffer is also used to pass disc commands and parameters to the controller,
   and to receive status information from the controller.  Only one buffer is
   needed per interface, regardless of the number of controllers or units
   handled, as a single interface cannot perform data transfers concurrently
   with controller commands.

   The library provides routines to prepare, start, and end commands, service
   units, and poll drives for Attention status.  In addition, routines are
   provided to attach and detach disc images from drive units, load and unload
   disc heads, classify commands, and provide opcode and phase name strings for
   debugging.

   Autosizing is supported when attaching a disc image.  If enabled, the model
   of the drive is set to match the disc image size.  For example, if a 50 MB
   disc image is attached to a unit set for autosizing, the unit's model will be
   set to a 7920(H).

   The interface simulator declares a structure that contains the state
   variables for a controller.  A MAC controller may handle multiple disc units.
   An ICD controller handles only a single disc unit, but multiple controllers
   may be employed to support several drives on a given interface.  The type of
   the controller (MAC or ICD) is contained in the structure, which is passed to
   the disc library routines.  The minor differences in controller action
   between the two are handled internally.  A macro (CNTLR_INIT) is provided to
   initialize the structure.

   The interface simulator also declares the sector buffer.  The buffer is an
   array containing DL_BUFSIZE 16-bit elements.  The address of the buffer is
   stored in the controller state structure.  The controller maintains the
   current index into the buffer, as well as the length of valid data stored
   there.  Other than setting the length when the controller places data into
   the buffer and resetting the index at the start of a sector read or write,
   the interface simulator is free to manipulate these values as desired.

   In general, a user of the library is free to read any of the controller state
   variable structure fields.  Writing to the fields generally will interfere
   with controller operations, with these exceptions:

     Field Name   Description
     ===========  ============================
     status       controller status
     eod          end of data flag
     index        data buffer index
     length       data buffer length
     seek_time    per-cylinder seek delay time
     sector_time  intersector delay time
     cmd_time     command response time
     data_time    data transfer response time
     wait_time    command wait time

   In hardware, the controller executes in three basic states:

    1. In the Poll Loop, which looks for commands and drive attention requests.

       In each pass of the loop, the next CPU interface in turn is checked for a
       command; if present, it is executed.  If none are pending, all drives are
       checked in turn until one is found with Attention status; if none are
       found, the loop continues.  If a drive is requesting attention, the
       associated CPU interface is connected to check for a command; if present,
       it is executed.  If not, and the interface allows interrupts, an
       interrupt request is made and the Command Wait Loop is entered.  If
       interrupts are not allowed, the Poll Loop continues.

    2. In the Command Wait Loop, which looks for commands.

       In each pass of the loop, the current CPU interface is checked for a
       command; if present, it is executed.  If not, the Command Wait Loop
       continues.  While in the loop, a 1.8 second timer is running.  If it
       expires before a command is received, the file mask is reset, and the
       Poll Loop is entered.

    3. In command execution, which processes the current command.

       During command execution, the waits for input parameters, seek
       completion, data transfers, and output status words are handled
       internally.  Each wait is governed by the 1.8 second timer; if it
       expires, the command is aborted.

   In simulation, these states are represented by the values cntlr_idle,
   cntlr_wait, and cntlr_busy, respectively.

   A MAC controller operates from one to eight drives, represented by an array
   of one to eight units.  When operating multiple units, a pointer to the first
   unit of a contiguous array is passed, and the unit number present in the
   command is used to index to the target unit.

   A MAC controller emulation also requires an array of two contiguous auxiliary
   units containing a controller unit and a command wait timeout unit.  Commands
   that do not access the drive, such as Address Record, are scheduled on the
   controller unit to allow controller commands to execute while drive units are
   seeking.  The command wait timer limits the amount of time the controller
   will wait for the interface to supply a command or parameter.  A pointer to
   the auxiliary unit array is set up during controller state variable
   initialization.  The auxiliary array may be separate or an extension of the
   drive unit array.

   An ICD controller manages a single unit corresponding to the drive in which
   the controller is integrated.  An interface declares a unit array
   corresponding to the number of drives supported and passes the unit number to
   use to the command preparation and start routines.  Auxiliary units are not
   used, and all commands are scheduled on the drive unit associated with a
   given controller.

   The library provides a unit service routine to handle all of the disc
   commands.  The routine is called from the interface service routine to handle
   the common disc actions, while the interface routine handles actions specific
   to the operation of the interface (such as data transfer).

   The service routine schedules the unit to continue command execution under
   these conditions:

     1. A Seek or Recalibrate command is waiting for the seek completion.

     2. A read or write command is waiting for the first data transfer of a
        sector to start.

     3. A read or write command is waiting for the next sector to start after
        the final data transfer of the preceding sector.

     4. A Verify command is waiting for the end of the current sector.

   The library also provides controller and timer service routines for MAC
   emulations.  All three (unit, controller, and timer) must be called from
   their respective interface service routines before any interface-specific
   actions, if any, are taken.

   On return from the library unit or controller service routines, the "wait"
   field of the UNIT structure will be set to the activation time if the unit
   is to be scheduled.  The caller is responsible for activating the unit.  If
   the caller uses this feature, the field should be reset to zero before the
   next service call.

   The MAC timer unit is activated by the library, and its "wait" field is not
   used.  The timer starts when a command other than End, Seek, or Recalibrate
   completes, or when the controller is waiting for the interface to supply or
   accept a parameter during command execution.  It stops when an End, Seek, or
   Recalibrate command completes, a command is prepared for execution, or the
   final parameter has been supplied or accepted by the interface during command
   execution.

   The controller maintains six variables in each drive's unit structure:

     wait       -- the current service activation time
     pos        -- the current byte offset into the disc image file
     u3 (CYL)   -- the current drive cylinder
     u4 (STAT)  -- the drive status (Status-2)
     u5 (OP)    -- the drive operation in process
     u6 (PHASE) -- the current operation phase

   These and other definitions are in the file hp_disclib.h, which must be
   included in the interface simulator.

   The controller library supports up to eight drives per MAC controller and one
   drive per ICD controller.  Unit numbers 0-7 represent valid drive addresses
   for a MAC controller.  The unit number field is ignored for an ICD
   controller, and unit 0 is always implied.  In simulation, MAC unit numbers
   correspond one-for-one with device units, whereas one ICD controller is
   associated with each of the several device units that are independently
   addressed as unit 0.

   The MAC controller firmware allows access to unit numbers 8-10 without
   causing a Unit Unavailable error.  Instead, the controller reports these
   legal-but-invalid units as permanently offline.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The library does not simulate sector headers and trailers.  Initialize
       and Write Full Sector commands ignore the SPD bits and the supplied
       header and trailer words.  Read Full Sector fills in the header with the
       current CHS address and sets the SPD bits to zero.  The CRC and ECC words
       in the trailer are returned as zeros.  Programs that depend on drives
       retaining the set values will fail.

    2. The library does not simulate drive hold bits or support multiple CPU
       interfaces connected to the same controller.  CPU access to a valid drive
       always succeeds.

    3. The library does not simulate interface signals or function bus orders,
       except for EOD (End of Data) and BUSY.  The interface simulators must
       decide for themselves what actions to take (e.g., interrupting the CPU)
       on the basis of the controller state.

    4. The command/sector buffer is an array of 16-bit elements.  Byte-oriented
       interface simulators, such as the 12821A HP-IB Disc Interface, must do
       their own byte packing and unpacking.

    5. The SAVE command does not save the "wait" and "pos" fields of the UNIT
       structure automatically.  To ensure that they are saved, they are
       referenced by hidden, read-only registers.

/* Drive properties table.

   In hardware, drives report their Drive Type numbers to the controller upon
   receipt of a Request Status tag bus command.  The drive type is used to
   determine the legal range of head and sector addresses (the drive itself will
   validate the cylinder address during seeks).

   In simulation, we set up a table of drive properties and use the model ID as
   an index into the table.  The table is used to validate seek parameters and
   to provide the mapping between CHS addresses and the linear byte addresses
   required by the host file access routines.

   The 7905/06(H) drives consist of removable and fixed platters, whereas the
   7920(H)/25(H) drives have only removable multi-platter packs.  As a result,
   7905/06 drives are almost always accessed in platter mode, i.e., a given
   logical disc area is fully contained on either the removable or fixed
   platter, whereas the 7920/25 drives are almost always accessed in cylinder
   mode with logical disc areas spanning some or all of the platters.

   Disc image files are arranged as a linear set of tracks.  To improve
   locality of access, tracks in the 7905/06 images are grouped per-platter,
   whereas tracks on the 7920 and 7925 are sequential by cylinder and head
   number.

   The simulator maps the tracks on the 7905/06 removable platter (heads 0 and
   1) to the first half of the disc image, and the tracks on the fixed platter
   (heads 2 and, for the 7906 only, 3) to the second half of the image.  For the
   7906(H), the cylinder-head order of the tracks is 0-0, 0-1, 1-0, 1-1, ...,
   410-0, 410-1, 0-2, 0-3, 1-2, 1-3, ..., 410-2, 410-3.  The 7905 order is the
   same, except that head 3 tracks are omitted.

   For the 7920(H)/25(H), all tracks appear in cylinder-head order, e.g., 0-0,
   0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 1-0, 1-1, ..., 822-2, 822-3, 822-4 for the 7920(H).

   This variable-access geometry is accomplished by defining additional "heads
   per cylinder" values for the fixed and removable sections of each drive that
   indicates the number of heads that should be grouped for locality.  The
   removable values are set to 2 on the 7905 and 7906, indicating that those
   drives typically use cylinders consisting of two heads.  They are set to the
   number of heads per drive for the 7920 and 7925, as those typically use
   cylinders encompassing the entire pack.

     if Head < removable_heads_per_cylinder then

   On entry, the first word of the controller buffer contains the command to
   prepare, the "cvptr" parameter points at the controller state variable
   structure, and the "units" parameter points at the first unit of the unit
   array.  For a MAC controller, the "unit limit" parameter indicates the last
   valid unit number, and the unit to use is taken from the unit field of the
   command word.  For an ICD controller, the parameter indicates the number
   of the unit to use directly.

   If a valid command was prepared for execution, the routine returns TRUE and
   sets the controller state to "busy."  If the command is illegal, the routine
   returns FALSE and sets the controller state to "waiting."  In the latter
   case, the controller status will indicate the reason for the rejection.

   The opcode and unit number (for MAC controllers) are obtained from the buffer
   and checked for legality.  If either is illegal, the controller status is set
   appropriately, and the routine returns FALSE.

   For a valid command and an available unit, the controller's opcode field is
   set from the buffer, the length field is set to the number of inbound
   parameter words expected, and the index field is set to 1 to point at the
   first parameter entry in the buffer.

/* Start a command.

   On entry, the controller's opcode field contains the command to start, and
   the buffer contains the command word in element 0 and the parameters required
   by the command, if any, beginning in element 1.  The call parameters are the
   same as those supplied to the "prepare command" routine.

   If the command was started successfully, the routine returns a pointer to the
   unit to be activated and sets that unit's "wait" field to the activation
   time.  The caller should activate the unit upon return to complete or
   continue command processing.  If the command did not start, the routine
   returns NULL.

   If a seek is in progress on a drive when a command accessing that drive is
   started, the unit pointer is returned but the unit's "wait" field is set to
   zero.  In this case, the unit must not be activated (as it already is).
   Instead, the unit's opcode and phase fields will have been set to start the
   command automatically when the seek completes.

   For commands that return status from the controller, the buffer will contain
   the returned value(s), the buffer index will be zero, and the buffer length
   will be set to the number of words returned in the buffer.  These words must
   be returned to the CPU via the interface.


   Implementation notes:

    1. A command must have been prepared by calling dl_prepare_command first.
       After preparation, the controller's opcode will be valid, and the unit
       number field will be legal (but not necessarily valid) for those commands
       that check the unit.

       Unit numbers 0-7 represent valid drive addresses.  However, the MAC
       controller firmware allows access to unit numbers 8-10 without causing a
       Unit Unavailable error.  Instead, the controller reports these units as
       permanently offline.

    2. Commands that check for a valid unit do some processing before failing
       with a Status-2 (not ready) error if the unit is invalid.  For example,
       the Seek command accepts its parameters from the CPU and sets the CHS
       values into the controller before failing.

    3. In hardware, read, write, and recalibrate commands wait in an internal
       loop for a pending seek completion and clear the resulting Attention
       status before executing.  In simulation, we change a seeking drive unit's
       opcode and phase fields from seek completion to the start of the next
       command.  This eliminates the setting of the Attention status and begins
       command execution automatically when the seek completes.

       If the seek completed between the command preparation and start,
       Attention will have been set.  If the unit is idle on entry, we clear the
       Attention status unilaterally (it doesn't matter whether or not it was
       set; Attention always is clear when commands start).

    4. The Seek and Cold Load Read commands do not check for a seek or
       recalibrate in progress.  If the heads are moving, the drive will reject
       a seek command with a Seek Check error.  The firmware does not test
       explicitly for Access Not Ready before executing the command, so the
       parameters (e.g., controller CHS addresses) are still set as though the
       command had succeeded.

       A Seek command will return to the Poll Loop with Seek Check status set.
       When the seek in progress completes, the controller will interrupt with
       Drive Attention status.  The controller address will differ from the
       drive address, so it's incumbent upon the caller to issue a Request
       Status command after the seek, which will return Status-2 Error status.

       A Cold Load Read command issues a seek to cylinder 0 and then begins a
       read, which first waits for seek completion.  The Seek Check error will
       abort the command at this point with Status-2 Error status.

       In simulation, a Seek command allows the seek in progress to complete
       normally, whereas a Cold Load Read command modifies the unit command
       and phase from the end phase of Seek or Recalibrate to the start
       phase of Read, which will catch the Seek Check error as in hardware.

    5. The Cold Load Read command checks if the drive is ready before setting
       the file mask.  Therefore, we normally defer setting the file mask until
       the unit service is called.  However, if a seek is in progress, then the
       drive must be ready, so we set the file mask here.

    6. ECC is not simulated, so the Request Syndrome command always returns zero
       values for the displacement and patterns.

    7. The Request Status, Request Sector Address, and Wakeup commands reference
       drive units but are scheduled on the controller unit because they may be
       issued while a drive is processing a seek.

    8. The activation time is set to the intersector time (latency) for read and
       write commands, and to the controller processing time for all others.
       The read/write start time cannot be shorter than 20 instructions, or
       DVR32 will be unable to start DCPC in time to avoid an over/underrun.

/* Service the disc drive unit.

   The unit service routine is called to execute scheduled controller commands
   for the specified unit.  The actions to be taken depend on the current state
   of the controller and the unit.

   In addition to the controller state variables supplied in the call, the
   service routine accesses these six variables in the UNIT structure:

     wait       -- the current service activation time
     pos        -- the current byte offset into the disc image file
     u3 (CYL)   -- the current drive cylinder
     u4 (STAT)  -- the drive status (Status-2)
     u5 (OP)    -- the drive operation in process
     u6 (PHASE) -- the current operation phase

   The activation time is set non-zero if the service should be rescheduled.
   The caller is responsible upon return for activating the unit.  The file
   offset indicates the byte position in the disc image file for the next read
   or write operation.

   The drive cylinder gives the current location of the head positioner.  This
   may differ from the cylinder value in the controller if the Address Record
   command has been used.  The drive status maintains various per-drive
   conditions (e.g., the state of the read-only and format switches, drive
   ready, first status).  The operation in process and operation phase define
   the action to be taken by this service routine.

   Initially, the operation in process is set to the opcode field of the command
   when it is started.  However, the operation in process may change during
   execution (the controller opcode never does).  This is to aid code reuse in
   the service routine.  For example, a Cold Load Read command is changed to a
   Read command once the seek portion is complete, and a Read Without Verify
   command is changed to a normal Read command after a track boundary is
   crossed.

   The operation phase provides different substates for those commands that
   transfer data or that have different starting and ending actions.  Three
   phases are defined: start, data, and end.  Commands that do not transfer data
   to or from the CPU interface do not have data phases, and commands that
   complete upon first service do not have end phases.  The service routine
   validates phase assignments and returns SCPE_IERR (Internal Error) if entry
   is made with an illegal operation phase or a phase that is not valid for a
   given operation.

   An operation in the data phase is in the process of transferring data between
   the CPU and sector buffer.  Because this process is interface-specific, the
   service routine does nothing (other than validate) in this phase.  It is up
   to the caller to transition from the data phase to the end phase when the
   transfer is complete.

   If an operation is completed, or an error has occurred, the controller state
   on return will be either idle or waiting, instead of busy.  The caller should
   check the controller status to determine if normal completion or error
   recovery is appropriate.

   If the command is continuing, the service activation time will be set
   appropriately.  The caller should then call sim_activate to schedule the next
   service and clear the "wait" field in preparation for the next service call.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The Cold Load Read and Seek commands check only the drive's Not Ready
       status because seeking clears a Seek Check.  The other commands that
       access the unit (e.g., Read and Write) have already checked in the
       command start routine for Not Ready, Seek Check, or Fault status and
       terminated with a Status-2 error.

    2. Several commands (e.g., Set File Mask, Address Record) are executed
       completely within the dl_start_command routine, so all we do here is
       finish the command with the expected status.  The service routine is
       called only to provide the proper command execution delay.

    3. If a host file system error occurs, the service routine returns SCPE_IERR
       to stop simulation.  If simulation is resumed, the controller will behave
       as though an uncorrectable data error had occurred.

   The controller service routine is called to execute scheduled controller
   commands that do not access drive units.  It is also called to obtain command
   parameters from the interface and to return command result values to the
   interface.  The actions to be taken depend on the current state of the
   controller.

   Controller commands are scheduled on a separate unit to allow concurrent
   processing while seeks are in progress.  For example, a seek may be started
   on unit 0.  While the seek is in progress, the CPU may request status from
   the controller.  In between returning the first and second status words to
   the CPU, the seek may complete.  Separating the controller unit allows seek
   completion to be handled while the controller is "busy" waiting for the CPU
   to indicate that it is ready for the second word.

   For ICD controllers, the controller unit is not used, and all commands are
   scheduled on the drive unit.  This is possible because ICD controllers always
   wait for seeks to complete before executing additional commands.  To reduce
   code duplication, however, the drive unit service calls the controller
   service directly to handle controller commands.

   The service routine validates phase assignments and returns SCPE_IERR
   (Internal Error) if entry is made with an illegal operation phase or a phase
   that is not valid for a given operation.

   Implementation notes:

    1. While the interface simulator is responsible for data phase transfers,
       the controller service routine is responsible for (re)starting and
       stopping the command wait timer for each parameter sent to and received
       from the interface.

/* Service the command wait timer unit.

   The command wait timer service routine is called if the command wait timer
   expires.  This indicates that the CPU did not respond to a parameter transfer
   or did not issue a new command within the ~1.8 second timeout period.  The
   timer is used with the MAC controller to ensure that a hung CPU does not tie
   up the controller, preventing it from servicing other CPUs or drives.  ICD
   controllers do not use the command wait timer; they will wait forever, as
   each controller is dedicated to a single interface.

   When a timeout occurs, the controller unit is cancelled in case the cause was
   a parameter timeout.  Then the file mask is reset, and the controller is
   idled.

   The interface is responsible for polling for a new command and for drive
   attention when a timeout occurs.

   Implementation notes:

    1. Only the controller unit may be active when the command wait timer
       expires.  A unit is never active because the timer is cancelled when
       commands are executing and is restarted after the command completes.

/* Clear the controller.

   The controller connected to the specified unit is cleared as directed.  A MAC
   controller is connected to several units, so the unit is used to find the
   associated device and thereby the unit array.  An ICD controller is connected
   only to the specified unit.

   In hardware, four conditions clear the 13037 controller:

    - an initial application of power
    - an assertion of the CLEAR signal by the CPU interface
    - a timeout of the command wait timer
    - a programmed Clear command

   The first two conditions, called "hard clears," are equivalent and cause a
   firmware restart with the PWRON flag set.  The 13175 interface for the HP
   1000 asserts the CLEAR signal in response to the backplane CRS signal if the
   PRESET ENABLE jumper is not installed (which is the usual case).  The third
   condition also causes a firmware restart but with the PWRON flag clear.  The
   last condition is executed in the command handler and therefore returns to
   the Command Wait Loop instead of the Poll Loop.

   For a hard clear, the 13037 controller will:

    - disconnect the CPU interface
    - zero the controller RAM (no drives held, last polled unit number reset)
    - issue a Controller Preset to clear all connected drives
    - clear the clock offset
    - clear the file mask
    - enter the Poll Loop (which clears the controller status)

   For a timeout clear, the 13037 controller will:

    - disconnect the CPU interface
    - clear the hold bits of any drives held by the interface that timed out
    - clear the clock offset
    - clear the file mask
    - enter the Poll Loop (which clears the controller status)

   For a programmed "soft" clear, the 13037 controller will:

    - clear the controller status
    - issue a Controller Preset to clear all connected drives
    - enter the Command Wait Loop

   Controller Preset is a tag bus command that is sent to all drives connected
   to the controller.  Each drive will:

    - disconnect from the controller
    - clear its internal drive faults
    - clear its head and sector registers
    - clear its illegal head and sector flip-flops
    - reset its seek check, first status, drive fault, and attention status

   In simulation, a hard clear occurs when a RESET -P or RESET command is
   issued, or a programmed CLC 0 instruction is executed.  A soft clear occurs
   when a programmed Clear command is started.  A timeout clear occurs when the
   command wait timer unit is serviced, but this action is handled in the timer
   unit service.

   Because the controller execution state is implemented by scheduling command
   phases for the target or controller unit, a simulated firmware restart must
   abort any in-process activation.  However, a firmware restart does not affect
   seeks in progress, so these must be allowed to continue to completion so that
   their Attention requests will be honored.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The specific 13365 controller actions on hard or soft clears are not
       documented.  Therefore, an ICD controller clear is handled as a MAC
       controller clear, except that only the current drive is preset (as an ICD
       controller manages only a single drive).

    2. Neither hard nor soft clears affect the controller flags (e.g., EOC) or
       registers (e.g., cylinder address).

    3. In simulation, an internal seek, such as an auto-seek during a Read
       command or the initial seek during a Cold Load Read command, will be
       aborted for a hard or timeout clear, whereas in hardware it would
       complete normally.  This is OK, however, because an internal seek always
       clears the drive's Attention status on completion, so aborting the
       simulated seek is equivalent to an immediate seek completion.

    4. In simulation, a Controller Preset only resets the specified status bits,
       as the remainder of the hardware actions are not implemented.

/* Start a read operation on the current sector.

   The current sector indicated by the controller address is read from the disc
   image file into the sector buffer in preparation for data transfer to the
   CPU.  If the end of the track had been reached, and the file mask permits,
   an auto-seek is scheduled instead to allow the read to continue.

   On entry, the end-of-data flag is checked.  If it is set, the current read is
   completed.  Otherwise, the buffer data offset and verify options are set up.
   For a Read Full Sector, the sync word is set from the controller type, and
   dummy cylinder and head-sector words are generated from the current location
   (as would be the case in the absence of track sparing).

   The image file is positioned to the correct sector in preparation for
   reading.  If the positioning requires a permitted seek, it is scheduled, and
   the routine returns with the operation phase unchanged to wait for seek
   completion before resuming the read (when the seek completes, the service
   routine will be entered, and we will be called again; this time, the
   end-of-cylinder flag will be clear and positioning will succeed).  If
   positioning resulted in an error, the current read is terminated with the
   error status set.

   If positioning succeeded within the same cylinder, the sector image is read
   into the buffer at an offset determined by the operation (Read Full Sector
   leaves room at the start of the buffer for the sector header).  If the image
   file read did not return a full sector, the remainder of the buffer is padded
   with zeros.  If the image read failed with a file system error, SCPE_IOERR is
   returned from the service routine to cause a simulation stop; resumption is
   handled as an Uncorrectable Data Error.

   If the image was read correctly, the next sector address is updated, the
   operation phase is set for the data transfer, and the index of the first word
   to transfer is set.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The length of the transfer required (cvptr->length) must be set before
       entry.

    2. Entry while executing a Read Without Verify or Read Full Sector command
       inhibits address verification.  The unit opcode is tested instead of the
       controller opcode because a Read Without Verify is changed to a Read to
       begin verifying after a track switch occurs.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The CPU indicates the end of a read data transfer to an ICD controller by
       untalking the drive.  The untalk is done by the driver as soon as the
       DCPC completion interrupt is processed.  However, the time from the final
       DCPC transfer through driver entry to the point where the untalk is
       asserted on the bus varies from 80 instructions (RTE-6/VM with OS
       microcode and the buffer in the system map) to 152 instructions (RTE-IVB
       with the buffer in the user map).  The untalk must occur before the start
       of the next sector, or the drive will begin the data transfer.

       Normally, this is not a problem, as the driver clears the FIFO of any
       received data after DCPC completion.  However, if the read terminates
       after the last sector of a track, and accessing the next sector would
       require an intervening seek, and the file mask disables auto-seeking or
       an enabled seek would move the positioner beyond the drive limits, then
       the controller will indicate an End of Cylinder error if the untalk does
       not arrive before the seek is initiated.

       The RTE driver (DVA32) and various utilities that manage the disc
       directly (e.g., SWTCH) do not appear to account for these bogus errors,
       so the ICD controller hardware must avoid them in some unknown manner.
       We work around the issue by extending the intersector delay to allow time
       for a potential untalk whenever the next access would otherwise fail.

       Note that this issue does not occur with writes because DCPC completion
       asserts EOI concurrently with the final data byte to terminate the
       command.

/* Start a write operation on the current sector.

   The current sector indicated by the controller address is positioned for
   writing from the sector buffer to the disc image file after data transfer
   from the CPU.  If the end of the track had been reached, and the file mask
   permits, an auto-seek is scheduled instead to allow the write to continue.

   On entry, if writing is not permitted, or formatting is required but not
   enabled, the command is terminated with an error.  Otherwise, the disc image
   file is positioned to the correct sector in preparation for writing.

   If the positioning requires a permitted seek, it is scheduled, and the
   routine returns with the operation phase unchanged to wait for seek
   completion before resuming the write (when the seek completes, the service
   routine will be entered, and we will be called again; this time, the
   end-of-cylinder flag will be clear and positioning will succeed).  If
   positioning resulted in an error, the current write is terminated with the
   error status set.

   If positioning succeeded within the same cylinder, the operation phase is set
   for the data transfer, and the index of the first word to transfer is set.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Entry while executing a Write Full Sector or Initialize command inhibits
       address verification.  In addition, the drive's FORMAT switch must be set
       to the enabled position for these commands to succeed.

   The current sector is written from the sector buffer to the disc image file
   at the current file position.  The next sector address is then updated to
   allow writing to continue.

   On entry, the drive is checked to ensure that it is ready for the write.
   Then the sector buffer is padded appropriately if a full sector of data was
   not transferred.  The buffer is written to the disc image file at the
   position corresponding to the controller address as set when the sector was
   started.  The write begins at a buffer offset determined by the command (a
   Write Full Sector has header words at the start of the buffer that are not
   written to the disc image).

   If the image write failed with a file system error, SCPE_IOERR is returned
   from the service routine to cause a simulation stop; resumption is handled as
   an Uncorrectable Data Error.  If the image was written correctly, the next
   sector address is updated.  If the end-of-data flag is set, the current write
   is completed.  Otherwise, the command phase is reset to start the next
   sector, and the disc service is scheduled to allow for the intersector delay.

    1. A partial sector is filled with 177777B words (ICD) or copies of the last
       word (MAC) per page 7-10 of the ICD/MAC Disc Diagnostic manual.

/* Position the disc image file at the current sector.

   The image file is positioned at the byte address corresponding to the drive's
   current cylinder and the controller's current head and sector addresses.
   Positioning may involve an auto-seek if a prior read or write addressed the
   final sector of a cylinder.  If a seek is initiated or an error is detected,
   the routine returns FALSE to indicate that the positioning was not performed.
   If the file was positioned, the routine returns TRUE.

   On entry, if the controller's end-of-cylinder flag is set, a prior read or
   write addressed the final sector in the current cylinder.  If the file mask
   does not permit auto-seeking, the current command is terminated with an End
   of Cylinder error.  Otherwise, the cylinder is incremented or decremented as
   directed by the file mask, and a seek to the new cylinder is started.

   If the increment or decrement resulted in an out-of-bounds value, the seek
   will return Seek Check status, and the command is terminated with an error.
   If the seek is legal, the routine returns with the disc service scheduled for
   seek completion and the command state unchanged.  When the service is
   reentered, the read or write will continue on the new cylinder.

   If the EOC flag was not set, the drive's position is checked against the
   controller's position if address verification is requested.  If they are
   different (as may occur with an Address Record command that specified a
   different location than the last Seek command), a seek is started to the
   correct cylinder, and the routine returns with the disc service scheduled for
   seek completion as above.

   If the drive and controller positions agree or verification is not requested,
   the CHS addresses are validated against the drive limits.  If they are
   invalid, Seek Check status is set, and the command is terminated with an
   error.

   If the addresses are valid, the drive is checked to ensure that it is ready
   for positioning.  If it is, the the byte offset in the image file is
   calculated from the CHS address, and the file is positioned.  The disc
   service is scheduled to begin the data transfer, and the routine returns TRUE
   to indicate that the file position was set.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The ICD controller returns an End of Cylinder error if an auto-seek
       results in a position beyond the drive limits.  The MAC controller
       returns a Status-2 error.  Both controllers set the Seek Check bit in the
       drive status word.

/* Start a seek.

   A seek is initiated on the indicated unit if the drive is ready and the
   cylinder, head, and sector values in the controller are valid for the current
   drive model.  If the current operation is a recalibrate, a seek is initiated
   to cylinder 0 instead of the cylinder value stored in the controller.  The
   routine returns TRUE if the drive was ready for the seek and FALSE if it was
   not.

   If the controller cylinder is beyond the drive's limit, Seek Check status is
   set in the unit, and the heads are not moved.  Otherwise, the relative
   cylinder position change is calculated, and the heads are moved to the new
   position.

   If the controller head or sector is beyond the drive's limit, Seek Check
   status is set in the unit.  Otherwise, Seek Check status is cleared, and the
   new file offset is calculated.

   A seek check terminates the current command for an ICD controller.  For a MAC
   controller, the seek check is noted in the drive status, but processing will
   continue until the drive sets Attention status.

   Finally, the drive operation and phase are set to the supplied values before
   returning.


   Implementation notes:

    1. EOC is not reset for recalibrate so that a reseek will return to the same
       location as was current when the recalibrate was done.

    2. Calculation of the file offset is performed here simply to keep the unit
       position register available for inspection.  The actual file positioning
       is done in position_sector.

    3. In hardware, a seek to the current location will set Drive Busy status
       for 1.3 milliseconds (the head settling time).  In simulation, disc
       service is scheduled as though a one-cylinder seek was requested.

/* Return the drive status (status word 2).

   In hardware, the controller outputs the Address Unit command on the drive tag
   bus and the unit number on the drive control bus.  The addressed drive then
   responds by setting its internal "selected" flag.  The controller then
   outputs the Request Status command on the tag bug, and the selected drive
   returns its status on the control bus.  If a drive is selected but the heads
   are unloaded, the drive returns Not Ready and Busy status.  If no drive is
   selected, the control bus floats inactive.  This is interpreted by the
   controller as Not Ready status (because the drive returns an inactive Ready
   status).

   In simulation, an enabled but detached unit corresponds to "selected but
   heads unloaded," and a disabled unit corresponds to a non-existent unit.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The Attention, Drive Fault, First Status, and Seek Check bits are stored
       in the unit status word.  The other status bits are determined
       dynamically.

    2. The Drive Busy bit is set if the unit service is scheduled.  In hardware,
       this bit indicates that the heads are not positioned over a track, i.e.,
       that a seek is in progress.  In simulation, the only time a Request
       Status command is allowed is either when the controller is waiting for
       seek completion or for a new command.  In the latter case, unit service
       will not be scheduled, so activation can only be for seek completion.
