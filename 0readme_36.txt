Notes For V3.6-0

The save/restore format has been updated to improve its reliability.
As a result, save files prior to release 3.0 are no longer supported.

The text documentation files are obsolete and are no longer included
with the distribution.  Up-to-date PDF documentation files are
available on the SimH web site.
