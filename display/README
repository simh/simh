Designed for use with Bob Supnik's SIMH, but the code should be easily
portable, and usable standalone (see vttest.c for an example).

Display code is provided for X11 (Unix/VMS) and Win32.
We're not GUI programmers, so the code is PRIMITIVE!!

Started from VC8E simulator by Douglas W. Jones
(distribution 5, of Feb 4, 1997);

        This PDP8 Emulator was written by Douglas W. Jones at the
        University of Iowa.  It is distributed as freeware, of
        uncertain function and uncertain utility.

Original phosphor decay constants for Type 30 display from XMame 0.72.1

VT11 support GREATLY enhanced (and VT48 support added) and
other general improvements from Douglas A Gwyn.

In the interest of fair play we have supplied two makefiles (neither
of which is named Makefile nor makefile), one which works under all
flavors of "make" (after necessary editing, in the traditional manner),
and one which functions only under the GNU version of make (sometimes
installed as "gmake", but the default "make" on many systems).  We have
not added a third flavor which uses BSD make enhancements, because our
deeply held roots (over 40 combined years of Unix experience by the
authors) demand that things should work on all platforms.  Both the
Linux and Windows worlds violate this simple credo (everything works so
long as you use OUR preferred software), and many current users may not
even realize that editing Makefiles used to be de rigeur.  Since the
GNU environment is widely available and "gmake" has features that
support automatic configuration for multiple platforms, we have
supplied thr GNU-specific variant with the expectation that many users
will find it more convenient.  You can copy or link whichever flavor of
makefile suits your taste to whichever spelling of "makefile" suits
your fancy, or invoke "make" with the -f flag specifying the desired
makefile.

To compile test programs:
========================
On Unix:
        # edit smakefile to match your environment
        make -f smakefile
or
        gmake -f gmakefile

On Win32 (using Cygwin);
        make -f gmakefile WIN32=1

On Win32 (using MINGW):
        # edit smakefile to match your environment
        make -f smakefile
or
        mingw32-make -f gmakefile WIN32=1
or
        execute build-mingw.bat in a DOS command window

creates:

        munch:  standalone simulation of PDP-1 munching squares;
                examines console "test switches" (see next section)

        vt11:   sequences through VT11/VS60 simulator test displays;
                shows how the diplay-processor simulator can be used
                from applications other than PDP-11 simulators

Console switches:
================

Upto 18 simulated console switches, toggled by hitting keys:

123 456 789 qwe rty uio

space bar clears all switches.

Spacewar Switches:
=================

Key presses for simulated Spacewar control box switches;

action                          player
                                1       2
rotate clockwise                a       k
rotate counter clockwise        s       l
fire engines                    d       ;
launch torpedo                  f       '
hyperspace (both at once)       as      kl

Light pen:
=========

The light pen is active when any mouse button is held down.

Mouse button 1 acts as a "tip switch" for models so equipped (VS60).
The light pen may be dragged while active.

Too many compile time parameters:
================================

Read the comments in display.c for more explanations!!

DISPLAY_TYPE    default display type, one of:
                DIS_VR14, DIS_VR17, DIS_VR20, DIS_VR48, DIS_TYPE30, DIS_TYPE340
                selects screen characteristics (phosphor, dimensions).

                Only affects programs which do not make an expicit
                display_init() call.

PIX_SCALE       one of RES_FULL, RES_HALF, RES_QUARTER, RES_EIGHTH
                selects default display scaling factor.

PEN_RADIUS      default radius of light pen in (scaled) pixels

MAXELAPSED      Upper limit in real microseconds between polls/delays
MINELAPSED      Lower limit in real microseconds between polls/delays
MINDELAY        Lower limit in real microseconds for attempted delay
MAXDELAY        Upper limit in real microseconds for attempted delay
GAINSHIFT       delay_check increment/decrement gain factor

In display system support (x11.c, win32.c);

PIX_SIZE        selects displayed pixel size (default 1)
                makes screen larger, useful when display scaled to small size

Programming interface:
=====================

see display.h
