This file summarizes below the general simh license (indented) which is 
essentially stated at the top of all source code files with the respective 
authors mentioned there.  Pay particular attention to the paragraphs 
(beyond the indented section) which add some specific constraints.

   Except as contained in this notice, the name of Robert M Supnik, Mark 
   Pizzolato or anyone else shall not be used in advertising or otherwise to

   written authorization from all those parties.


Additionally, the following restrictions on the use of this software apply
and, where applicable, thereby override the "without limitation" clause 
above or in each relevant source code module.

Any use of this codebase that changes the code to influence the behavior of 
the disk access activities provided by sim_disk.c and scp.c is free to do 
that as long as anyone doing this is explicitly not licensed to any subsequent 
changes to any part of the codebase made by Mark Pizzolato after the
LICENSE.txt was added to the repository. Changes that qualify for this
restriction at least include: changing the behavior or default of 
SET AUTOSIZE/NOAUTOSIZE, or any code in scp.c and sim_disk.c or any simulator 
components that use the sim_disk routines.

All changes to the codebase made by Mark Pizzolato after the inclusion of 
the first version of this LICENSE.txt file in the github simh repository 
will be not be licensed for use by anyone making any of the above mentioned 
sim_disk/autosize related changes.

There are three potential categories of users who may need clarification 
when interpreting the above license wording:

Group 1: Any person who uses completely unmodified code from the repo is 
         licensed to use all of "Mark Pizzolato's future changes".
Group 2: Any person using a simulator that has no devices which use sim_disk
         and that doesn't modify scp.c is licensed to use all of "Mark 
         Pizzolato's future changes".
Group 3: Any person who finds it desireable to change the AUTOSIZE 
         functionality of scp.c or any aspect of the sim_disk.c is NOT 
         licensed for any of "Mark Pizzolato's future changes".

Note: Mark Pizzolato's future changes are commits made to the repository 
      authored by Mark Pizzolato after the first version of this LICENSE.txt 
      was added to the repository.

For many years, there exist some binary files in the repository which may 
not have formal copyright releases from the original copyright holders and 
therefore those are certainly not granted a license by this LICENSE.txt file.

Upon specific request any such unlicensed will be removed.
