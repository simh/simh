(drive 1) includes FORTRAN.

2. PDP-11

2.1 UNIX V5, V6, V7

UNIX was first developed on the PDP-7; its first widespread usage was on
the PDP-11.  UNIX provides a program development and execution environment
for assembler and C programs.  UNIX V5, V7, V7 for the PDP-11 is provided
under license, as is, without fee, by Santa Cruz Organization (SCO), for
non-commercial use only.  Please read the enclosed license agreement for
full terms and conditions.  This license must be reproduced with any copy
of the UNIX V5, V6, V7 disk images.  My thanks to PUPS, the PDP-11 UNIX
Preservation Society of Australia, which provided the disk images, and to
SCO, which provided the license.

2.1.1 UNIX V5

UNIX V5 is contained on a single RK05 disk image.  To boot UNIX:

	sim> set cpu 18b
	sim> att rk0 unix_v5_rk.dsk
	sim> boot rk
	@unix
	login: root
	#ls -l

2.1.2 UNIX V6

UNIX V6 is contained on three RK05 disk images.  To boot UNIX:

	sim> set cpu 18b
	sim> att rk0 unix0_v6_rk.dsk
	sim> att rk1 unix1_v6_rk.dsk
	sim> att rk3 unix3_v6_rk.dsk
	sim> boot rk0
	@unix
	login: root
	# ls -l

2.1.3 UNIX V7

NOTE: The V7 disk images with V2.3c and later releases are new and
replace the prior versions, which were corrupt.

UNIX V7 is contained on a single RL02 disk image.  To boot UNIX:

	sim> set cpu 18b
	sim> set rl0 RL02
	sim> att rl0 unix_v7_rl.dsk
	sim> boot rl0
	@boot
	New Boot, known devices are hp ht rk rl rp tm vt
	: rl(0,0)rl2unix
	# 

A smaller image is contained on a single RK05 disk image.  To boot UNIX:

	sim> set cpu 18b
	sim> att rk0 unix_v7_rk.dsk
	sim> boot rk0
	@boot
	New Boot, known devices are hp ht rk rl rp tm vt
	: rk(0,0)rkunix
	# STTY -LCASE
	#

2.2 RT-11

RT-11 is the PDP-11's single user operating system.  It provides a program
development and execution environment for assembler, BASIC, and FORTRAN
programs.  RT-11 is provided under license, as is, without fee, by Mentec
Corporation, for non-commercial use ONLY ON THIS SIMULATOR.  Please read
the enclosed license agreement for full terms and conditions.  This license
agreement must be reproduced with any copy of the RT-11 disk image.  My
thanks to John Wilson, a private collector, who provided the disk image
for RT-11 V4; to Megan Gentry, of Digital Equipment Corporation, who
provided the disk image for RT-11 V5.3; and to Mentec Corporation, which
provided the license.

2.2.1 RT-11 V4

RT-11 is contained in a single RK05 disk image.  To boot and run RT-11:

	sim> att rk0 rtv4_rk.dsk
	sim> boot rk0

For RL, RM, and RP series disks, RT-11 expects to find a manufacturer's bad
block table in the last track of the disk.  Therefore, INITialization of a
new (all zero's) disk fails, because there is no valid bad block table.  To
create a minimal bad block table, use the SET <unit> BADBLOCK command.

2.2.2 RT-11 V5.3

RT-11 is contained in a single RL02 disk image.  To boot and run RT-11:

	sim> set rl0 rl02
	sim> att rl0 rtv53_rl.dsk
	sim> boot rl0

This is a full RT-11 distribution kit.  It expects the user to copy the
distribution pack and generate a new system.  This requires mounting
blank packs on RL1.  When a blank pack is attached to the simulator,
a bad block table must be created with the SET <unit> BADBLOCK command. 

3. Nova RDOS

RDOS is the Nova's real-time mass storage operating system.  It provides a
program development and execution environment for assembler, BASIC, and
FORTRAN programs.  RDOS is provided under license, as is, without fee, by
Data General Corporation, for non-commercial use only.  Please read the
enclosed license agreement for full terms and conditions.  This license
agreement must be reproduced with any copy of the RDOS disk image.  My
thanks to Carl Friend, a private collector, who provided the disk image,
and to Data General Corporation, which provided the license.

To boot and run RDOS:

	sim> att dp0 rdos_d31.dsk
	sim> set tti dasher
	sim> boot dp0
	FILENAME? (cr)
	DATE (mm/dd/yy)? xx/yy/zz
	TIME (hh:mm:ss)? hh:mm:ss
	R
	list/e

4. PDP-1 LISP

PDP-1 LISP is an interactive interpreter for the Lisp language.  It can
execute both interactive commands and stored programs.  The startup
instructions for LISP are complicated; see the documentation included
with the program for details.  My thanks to Peter Deutsch, who wrote the
program, to Gordon Greene, who typed it in from a printed listing, and
to Paul McJones, who helped with the final debug process.

5. PDP-7 SIM8

PDP-7 SIM8 is a PDP-8 simulator for the PDP-7.  It implements an 8K
PDP-8/I with keyboard, teleprinter, reader, punch, and line printer.
It provides an interactive console environment for control and debug
of the simulated PDP-8.  For more information see the documentation
included with the program.  My thanks to Dave Waks, who wrote the
program, and to Paul Pierce and Tim Litt, who recovered the source
from its archival medium.

To load and run SIM8:

	sim> load sim8.rim
	sim> run
	AC/ 0000

6. PDP-15 FOCAL

FOCAL15 is an interactive program for technical computations.  It can
execute both immediate commands and stored programs (like BASIC).  FOCAL15
is provided as a binary loader format paper-tape image.  My thanks to Al
Kossow, who provided the binary image.  To load and run FOCAL15:

	sim> load focal15.bin
	sim> run
	*TYPE FSQT(2),!
	=    1.4142
	*

7. IBM 1401 

7.1 Single Card "Koans"

One of the art forms for the IBM 1401 was packing useful programs into a
single punched card.  Three samples are included:

i1401_ctolp.cd		prints a card deck on the line printer
i1401_ctopu.cd		copies a card deck to the card punch
i1401_hello.cd		prints "HELLO WORLD" on the line printer and stops

To use the reproduction cards, simply insert them at the beginning of a
text file, terminated by newline.  Attach the modified file to the card
reader, attach a blank file to the output device, and boot the card reader.

7.2 Diagnostic Tape

The software and writeup were provided by Charles Owens.

This 1401 Diagnostics tape is a bootable tape containing a series of 1401
diagnostics dating from about 1962.  The 1407 Inquiry console is not used;
all control is via the front panel.

To run in the simulator, attach thusly:

	sim> attach mt1 1401diag.mt
	sim> attach lpt errorlist.txt
	sim> boot mt1

The simulator will halt with IS = 433.  At this point, you can set options
through the sense switches and memory.

D 1252 "1"	Will cause headings to print for each test run. 
		Otherwise no printing will occur unless there are errors.
		
D SSB 1		Loop if an error is detected.

D SSC 1		Prints all test cases not just errors.

D SSD 1		Repeat the test run over and over.

D SSE 1		Halt if any error is detected, otherwise continue.

When you continue from this halt (use C to CON), the simulator will halt
at 3001.  Enter C again and the tape will spin thru a series of basic
CPU diagnostics.

7.3 SPS

The software and writeup were provided by Charles Owens.

sps1.obj and sps2.obj are the object card decks are the "Symbolic
Programming System", a primitive assembler for the 1401 that predates
the better known and more functional Autocoder.

To use SPS, write an SPS program using your favourite editor (two
examples are provided, hello.sps and diaglist.sps).  SPS decks are
not free-format, but operands must be placed in columns:

 1 -  5	Line Count (optional)
 6 -  7 Count (number of characters when defining a constant).
 8 - 13 Label (six characters must start with alphabetic).
14 - 16 Opcode: Examples:
		A = Add
		B = Branch (must be d-mod for conditional)
		BWZ = Branch if Wordmark or Zone
		C = Compare
		CC = Carriage Control (printer)
		CS = CLear Storage
		CU = Control Unit (e.g. tape)
		CW = Clear Workmark
		D = Divide
		DC = Define Constant (no wordmark)
		DCW = Define Constant (starts in 24, length in 6-7)
		END = End of program
		LCA = Load Characters
		H = Halt
		M = Multiply
		MCE = Move and Edit
		MCS = Move and Supress Zeros
		MCW = Move Characters
		MN = Move Numeric
		MZ = Move Zone
		ORG = Define Origin Point
		P = Punch Card
		R = Read Card
		S = Subtract
		SS = Stacker Select
		SW = Set Wordmark
		W = Write Line
		ZA = Zero and Add
		ZS = Zero and Subtract
	Tape:
		MCW %UX YYY W	Write Tape from addr YYY w/o wordmarks)
		LCA %UX YYY W	Write Tape, Unit X from addr YYY w/wordmarks)
		MCW %UX YYY R	Read Tape from addr YYY w/o wordmarks)
		LCA %UX YYY R	Read Tape, Unit X from addr YYY w/wordmarks)
		CU %UX M	Write Tape Mark
		CU %UX E	Skip and Blank Tape
		CU %UX B	Backspace Record
		CU %UX R	Rewind Tape
		CU %UX U	Rewind and Unlaod tape
17 - 22 Address for A-operand (label or 4-digit actual address)
23 - 23 blank, + or - to adjust A-operand by a constant
24 - 26 3-digit number to adjust A-operand by if 23 is + or -
27 - 27 Index (?)
28 - 33 Address for B-operand
34 - 34 Blank, + or -
35 - 37 3-digit number of adjust B-address by if 34 is + or -
38 - 38 Index (?)
39 - 39 D-modifier for this instruction.  Notes:
		/ = Compare is unequal
		S = Branch if Compare Equal
		T = B is less than A
		U = B is greater than A
		L = Tape read error
		K = Tape end of reel
40 - 55 Comments

The SPS deck should start with an ORG operation to specify where in storage
the program starts, and end with an END card, with an optional A-operand
showing where to start execution.

To assemble an SPS program, place the SPS source between the SPS1.OBJ and
the SPS2.OBJ deck, and another copy of the same source after the SPS2.OBJ
deck (SPS is a two-pass assembler).  SPS prints a listing on LPT and punches
an object deck on CDP, ready to run.

A UNIX command script to assemble an SPS deck painlessly is in "sps".  To
use the script, enter "sps programname".  The script creates programname.lst
for the listing and programname.obj for the object deck.  Windows users
are out of luck, for now.

8.  HP2116 16K BASIC

HP BASIC is a paper-tape centric implementation of BASIC for a 16KW
HP2116.  Device numbers correspond to the default simulator settings:

	PTR	=	10
	TTY	=	11
	PTP	=	12

The program is a complete but early BASIC and has one unsual requirement:
all programs must include a valid END statement to run correctly.  My
thanks to Jeff Moffatt for providing the program.

To load and run BASIC:

	sim> load basic1.abs
	sim> run 100
	READY
	10 PRINT SQR(2)
	20 END
	RUN
	 1.41421
