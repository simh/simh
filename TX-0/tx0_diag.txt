
Programs that are known to work well:

bin_tic-tac-toe_new_code_12-16-61.bin, seems to fully work:
    sim> boot petr
    sim> g (will halt with 205200 in LR)
    sim> e lr
    LR:     205200
    sim> g (again to start game.)
bin_tstDisplay.bin, makes a diagonal line on the DPY
bin_lightGunTst.bin, can draw on screen with light pen.


bin_newMouse_3-22-66.bin - These kind of work, but mouse gives up easy
bin_newMouse_8-14-61.bin - and can crash on complex mazes.  Sim bug
    somewhere.
