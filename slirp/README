This version of slirp is a fork from QEMU Version 2.4.0.1 slirp implementation
Taken from commit 83c92b45140be773f0c5545dddea35a89db1ad03 
in the qemu repository git://git.qemu.orgu/qemu.git

The goal being to absolutely mininize changes from the base qemu provided code 
so that the more active changes being done by the qemu folks can easily be 
adopted in the future by directly replacing the revised modules.  This is 
achieved by careful manipulation of the include files provided in the 
../slirp_glue directory so that things are stubbed out locally and the minimal 
capabilities needed for sim_ether integration are provided.

Thanks to Fabrice Bellard.
