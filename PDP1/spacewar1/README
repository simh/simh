README.MIT
	readme from MIT
	contains history, and instructions

spacewar.mac
        spacewar 3.1  (24 sep 62) retyped at MIT from a listing,
	originally assembled using a Perl macro-expander and assembler,
	and run under a Java PDP-1 emulator.

	This version modified by Phil Budne to assemble under his
	version of "macro1" (see below)

	Note that low memory (locations 6 thru 31) contains various
	manifest constants which can be tweaked to alter the game's
	behavior!

spacewar.rim
	above assembled by Phil Budne's macro1

	PDP-1 RIM of "loader" followed by loader blocks:

		PDP-1 simulator V4.0
		sim> set dpy enable
		sim> attach ptr spacewar.rim
		sim> boot ptr

	controls compatible with MIT Java simulation, see README.LCS
	or display/README from your SIMH distribution
	
	in order for "set dpy enable" to be successful, you must have
	compiled the pdp1 binary with libSDL or libSDL2 installed

munch.mac
	"munching squares" display hack, reconstructed
	from world.std.com/~dpbsmith/munch.html

munch.rim
	binary of munching squares.

	reads console switches:
            Upto 18 simulated console switches, toggled by hitting keys:

            123 456 789 qwe rty uio

            space bar clears all switches.

	assembled with '-r' option, so it can be "loaded" directly:
	
	PDP-1 simulator V4.0
	sim> set dpy enable
	sim> load munch.rim
	sim> run

	in order for "set dpy enable" to be successful, you must have
	compiled the pdp1 binary with libSDL or libSDL2 installed

macro1.c
	Phil Budne's version of the MACRO cross-assembler
