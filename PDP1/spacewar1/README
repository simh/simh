README.MIT
	readme from MIT
	contains history, and instructions

spacewar.mac
        spacewar 3.1  (24 sep 62) retyped at MIT from a listing,
	originally assembled using a Perl macro-expander and assembler,
	and run under a Java PDP-1 emulator.

	This version modified by Phil Budne to assemble under his
	version of "macro1" (see below)

	Note that low memory (locations 6 thru 31) contains various
	manifest constants which can be tweaked to alter the game's
	behavior!

spacewar.rim
	above assembled by Phil Budne's macro1

	PDP-1 RIM of "loader" followed by loader blocks:

		PDP-1 simulator V4.0
		sim> set dpy enable
		sim> attach ptr spacewar.rim
		sim> boot ptr

	controls compatible with MIT Java simulation, see README.LCS
	or display/README from your SIMH distribution

munch.mac
	"munching squares" display hack, reconstructed
	from world.std.com/~dpbsmith/munch.html

munch.rim
	binary of munching squares.

	reads console switches:
            Upto 18 simulated console switches, toggled by hitting keys:

            123 456 789 qwe rty uio

            space bar clears all switches.

	assembled with '-r' option, so it can be "loaded" directly:
	
	PDP-1 simulator V4.0
	sim> set dpy enable
	sim> load munch.rim
	sim> run

macro1.c
	Phil Budne's version of the MACRO cross-assembler
