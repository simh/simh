   Spacewar! was conceived in 1961 by Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell, and
   Wayne Wiitanen. It was first realized on the PDP-1 in 1962 by Stephen
   Russell, Peter Samson, Dan Edwards, and Martin Graetz, together with
   Alan Kotok, Steve Piner, and Robert A Saunders. Spacewar! is in the
   public domain, but this credit paragraph must accompany all
   distributed versions of the program.

   This is the original version! Martin Graetz provided us with a printed
   version of the source. We typed in in again - it was about 40 pages
   long - and re-assembled it with a PDP-1 assembler written in PERL. The
   resulting binary runs on a PDP-1 emulator written as a Java applet.
   The code is extremely faithful to the original. There are only two
   changes. 1)The spaceships have been made bigger and 2) The overall
   timing has been special cased to deal with varying machine speeds.

   The sources are available in a subdirectory called "sources".

   The "a", "s", "d", "f" keys control one of the spaceships. The "k",
   "l", ";", "'" keys control the other. The controls are spin one way,
   spin the other, thrust, and fire.
