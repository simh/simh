3. Background.

  The MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems) Altair 8800 was
announced on the January 1975 cover of Popular Electronics, which boasted
you could buy and build this powerful computer kit for only $397. The kit
consisted at that time of only the parts to build a case, power supply,
card cage (18 slots), CPU card, and memory card with 256 *bytes* of memory.
Still, thousands were ordered within the first few months after the
announcement, starting the personal computer revolution as we know it
today.

  Many laugh at the small size of the that first kit, noting there were no
peripherals and the 256 byte memory size.  But the computer was an open
system, and by 1977 MITS and many other small startups had added many
expansion cards to make the Altair quite a respectable little computer. The
"Altair Bus" that made this possible was soon called the S-100 Bus, later
adopted as an industry standard, and eventually became the IEE-696 Bus.


4. Hardware

  We are simulating a fairly "loaded" Altair 8800 from about 1977, with the
following configuration:

  device    simulates
  name(s)

  CPU       Altair 8800 with Intel 8080 CPU board, 62KB
            of RAM, 2K of EPROM with start boot ROM.
  SIO       MITS 88-2SIO Dual Serial Interface Board. Port 1
            is assumed to be connected to a serial "glass
            TTY" that is your terminal running the Simulator.
  PTR       Paper Tape Reader attached to port 2 of the 2SIO board.
  PTP       Paper Tape Punch attached to port 2 of the
            2SIO board.  This also doubles as a printer port.
  DSK       MITS 88-DISK Floppy Disk controller with up
            to eight drives.


4.1 CPU

  We have 2 CPU options that were not present on the original machine but
are useful in the simulator.  We also allow you to select memory sizes, but
be aware that some sample software requires the full 64K (i.e. CP/M) and
the MITS Disk Basic and Altair DOS require about a minimum of 24K.

  SET CPU 8080  Simulates the 8080 CPU (normal)
  SET CPU Z80   Simulates the Z80 CPU. Note that some software (e.g. most
      original Altair software such as 4K Basic) requires an 8080 CPU and
      will not or not properly run on a Z80. This is mainly due to the use
      of the parity flag on the 8080 which has not always the same
      semantics on the Z80.

  SET CPU ITRAP  Causes the simulator to halt if an invalid opcode
      is detected (depending on the chosen CPU).
  SET CPU NOITRAP  Does not stop on an invalid Opcode.  This is
      how the real 8080 works. Note that some software such as 4K Basic
      apparently tries to execute nonexistent 8080 instructions. Therefore
      it is advisable in this case to SET CPU NOITRAP.

  SET CPU 4K
  SET CPU 8K
  SET CPU 12K
  SET CPU 16K
    ...... (in 4K steps)
  SET CPU 64K  All these set various CPU memory configurations.

  SET CPU BANKED Enables the banked memory support. The simulated memory
      has eight banks with address range 0..'common' (see registers below)
      and a common area from 'common' to 0xfff which is common to all
      banks. The currently active bank is determined by register 'bank'
      (see below). You can only switch to banked memory if the memory
      is set to 64K. The banked memory is used by CP/M 3.

  SET CPU NONBANKED Disables banked memory support.

  SET CPU ROM Enables the ROM from address 'ROMLOW' to 'ROMHIGH'
      (see below under CPU Registers) and prevents write access
      to these locations. This is the default setting.

  SET CPU NOROM Disables the ROM.

  SET CPU ALTAIRROM Enables the slightly modified but downwards compatible
      Altair boot ROM at addresses 0FF00 to 0FFFF. This is the default.

  SET CPU NOALTAIRROM Disables standard Altair ROM behavior.

  SET CPU WARNROM Enables warning messages to be printed when the CPU
      attempts to write into ROM or into non-existing memory. Also prints
      a warning message if the CPU attempts to read from non-existing
      memory.

  SET CPU NOWARNROM Suppresses all warning message of "WARNROM". Note that
      some software tries on purpose to write to ROM in order to detect
      the available RAM.

  The BOOT EPROM card starts at address 0FF00 if it has been enabled by
'SET CPU ALTAIRROM'.  Jumping to this address will boot drive 0 of the
floppy controller (CPU must be set to ROM or equivalent code must be
present).  If no valid bootable software is present there the machine
crashes.  This is historically accurate behavior.

  The real 8080, on receiving a HLT (Halt) instruction, freezes the
processor and only an interrupt or CPU hardware reset will restore it.  The
simulator is a lot nicer, it will halt but send you back to the simulator
command line.

CPU Registers include the following:

  Name  Size  Comment

  PC      16  The Program Counter
  AF      16  The accumulator and the flag register
              F = S Z - AC - P/V N C
                S    = Sign flag.
                Z    = Zero Flag.
                AC   = Auxiliary Carry flag.
                P/V  = Parity flag on 8080
                       Parity / Overflow flag on Z80
                -    = not used (undefined)
                N    = Internal sign flag
                C    = Carry flag.
  BC      16  The BC register pair.
              Register B is the high 8 bits, C is the lower 8 bits
  DE      16  The DE register pair.
              Register D is the high 8 bits, E is the lower 8 bits.
  HL      16  The HL register pair.
              Register H is the high 8 bits, L is the lower 8 bits.
  AF1     16  The alternate AF register (on Z80 only)
  BC1     16  The alternate BC register (on Z80 only)
  DE1     16  The alternate DE register (on Z80 only)
  HL1     16  The alternate HL register (on Z80 only)
  IX      16  The IX index register     (on Z80 only)
  IY      16  The IY index register     (on Z80 only)
  IFF      8  Interrupt flag            (on Z80 only)
  INT      8  Interrupt register        (on Z80 only)

  SR      16  The front panel switches (use D SR 8 for 4k Basic).
  WRU      8  The interrupt character.  This starts as 5
              (ctrl-E) but some Altair software uses this
              keystroke so best to change this to something
              exotic such as 035 (which is Ctl-]).

  BANK     3  The currently active memory bank (if banked memory
              is activated - see memory options above)
  COMMON  16  The starting address of common memory. Originally set
              to 0xc000 (note this setting must agree with the
              value supplied to GENCPM for CP/M 3 system generation)
  ROMLOW  16  The starting address of the ROM. Default is 0FF00.
  ROMHIGH 16  The final address of the ROM. Default is 0FFFF.
  CLOCK   32  The clock speed of the simulated CPU in kHz or 0 to run
              at maximum speed. To set the clock speed for a typical
              4 MHz Z80 CPU, use D CLOCK 4000. The CP/M utility SPEED
              measures the clock speed of the simulated CPU.


4.2 The Serial I/O Card (2SIO)

  This simple programmed I/O device provides 2 serial ports to the outside
world, which could be hardware jumpered to support RS-232 plugs or a TTY
current loop interface.  The standard I/O addresses assigned by MITS was
10-11 (hex) for the first port, and 12-13 (hex) for the second. We follow
this standard in the Simulator.

  The simulator directs I/O to/from the first port to the screen. The
second port reads from an attachable "tape reader" file on input, and
writes to an attachable "punch file" on output.  These files are considered
a simple stream of 8-bit bytes.

  The SIO can be configured in SIMH with the following commands:

  SET SIO TTY      Bit 8 is set to zero on console output
  SET SIO ANSI     Bit 8 is not touched on console output

  SET SIO ALL      Console input remain unchanged
  SET SIO UPPER    Console input is transformed to upper case characters only
                   (This feature is useful for most Altair software)
                   SET SIO MAP must also have been executed for this
                   option to take effect - otherwise no mapping occurs.

  SET SIO BS       Map the delete character to backspace
                   SET SIO MAP must also have been executed for this
                   option to take effect - otherwise no mapping occurs.
  SET SIO DEL      Map the backspace character to delete
                   SET SIO MAP must also have been executed for this
                   option to take effect - otherwise no mapping occurs.

  SET SIO QUIET    Do not print warning messages
  SET SIO VERBOSE  Print warning messages (useful for debugging)
                   The register SIOWL determines how often the same warning
                   is displayed. The default is 3.

  SET SIO MAP      Enable mapping of characters
                   (see also SET SIO ALL/UPPER/BS/DEL)
  SET SIO NOMAP    Disable mapping of characters
                   (see also SET SIO ALL/UPPER/BS/DEL)

  You can also attach the SIO to a port:

  ATTACH SIO 23    Console IO goes via a Telnet connection on port 23
  DETACH SIO       Console IO goes via the regular SIMH console


4.3 The SIMH pseudo device

  The SIMH pseudo device facilitates the communication between the
simulated ALTAIR and the simulator environment. This device defines a
number of (most R/O) registers (see source code) which are primarily useful
for debugging purposes.

  The SIMH pseudo device can be configured with

  SET SIMH QUIET    Do not print warning messages
  SET SIMH VERBOSE  Print warning messages (useful for debugging)

  SET SIMH TIMERON  Start periodic timer interrupts
  SET SIMH TIMEROFF Stop the periodic timer interrupts

  The following variables determine the behavior of the timer:

  TIMD    This is the delay between consecutive interrupts in milliseconds.
          Use D TIMD 20 for a 50 Hz clock.
  TIMH    This is the address of the interrupt handler to call for a
          timer interrupt.


4.4 The 88-DISK controller.

  The MITS 88-DISK is a simple programmed I/O interface to the MITS 8-inch
floppy drive, which was basically a Pertec FD-400 with a power supply and
buffer board built-in.  The controller supports neither interrupts nor DMA,
so floppy access required the sustained attention of the CPU. The standard
I/O addresses were 8, 9, and 0A (hex), and we follow the standard.  Details
on controlling this hardware are in the altairz80_dsk.c source file.

  The only difference is that the simulated disks may be larger than the
original ones: The original disk had 77 tracks while the simulated disks
support up to 254 tracks (only relevant for CP/M). You can change the
number of tracks per disk by setting the appropriate value in TRACKS[..].
For example "D TRACKS[0] 77" sets the number of tracks for disk 0 to the
original number of 77. The command "D TRACKS[0-7] 77" changes the highest
track number for all disks to 77.

  For debugging purposes you can set the trace level of some disk I/O
functions. To do so the following bits in TRACE (a register of the disk)
have been defined with the following meaning:

  1 Trace all IN and OUT instructions on the disk ports 8 and 9
  2 Trace all read and writes to full sectors on the disk
  4 Print a message whenever an unnecessary step-in or step out of the
    disk head occurs (often an indication of an infinite loop)
  8 Print a message whenever the disk head appears to be waiting for a
    sector which does not show up (often an indication of an infinite
    loop)

For example the command "D TRACE 10" will trace options 2+8 from above.

  The DSK device can be configured with

  SET DSK<n> QUIET         Do not print warning messages for disk <n>
  SET DSK<n> VERBOSE       Print warning messages for disk <n>
                           (useful for debugging)
                           The register DSKWL determines how often the
                           same warning is displayed. The default is 3.

  SET DSK<n> WRITEENABLED  Allow write operations for disk <n>
  SET DSK<n> LOCKED        Disk <n> is locked, i.e. no write operations
                           will be allowed.


4.5 The simulated hard disk

  In order to increase the available storage capacity, the simulator
features 8 simulated hard disks with a capacity of 8MB (HDSK0 to HDSK7).
Currently only CP/M supports two hard disks as devices I: and J:.

  For debugging purposes one can set the trace flag by executing the
command "D HDTRACE 1". The default for "HDTRACE" is 0 (no trace).

  The HDSK device can be configured with

  SET HDSK<n> QUIET         Do not print warning messages for hard disk <n>
  SET HDSK<n> VERBOSE       Print warning messages for hard disk <n>
                            (useful for debugging)

  SET HDSK<n> WRITEENABLED  Allow write operations for hard disk <n>
  SET HDSK<n> LOCKED        Hard disk <n> is locked, i.e. no
                            write operations will be allowed.


5. Sample Software

  Running an Altair in 1977 you would be running either MITS Disk Extended
BASIC, or the brand new and sexy CP/M Operating System from Digital
Research.  Or possibly, you ordered Altair DOS back when it was promised in
1975, and are still waiting for it to be delivered in early 1977.

  We have samples of all three for you to check out.  We can't go into the
details of how they work, but we'll give you a few hints.


5.1 CP/M Version 2.2

  This version is my own port of the standard CP/M to the Altair. There
were some "official" versions but I don't have them.  None were endorsed or
sold by MITS to my knowledge, however.

  To boot CP/M:

  sim> attach dsk cpm2.dsk
  sim> boot dsk

  CP/M feels like DOS, sort of.  DIR will work.  I have included all the
standard CP/M utilities, plus a few common public-domain ones.  I also
include the sources to the customized BIOS and some other small programs.
TYPE will print an ASCII file.  DUMP will dump a binary one.  LS is a
better DIR than DIR.  ASM will assemble .ASM files to Hex, LOAD will "load"
them to binary format (.COM).  ED is a simple editor, #A command will bring
the source file to the buffer, T command will "type" lines, L will move
lines, E exits the editor.  20L20T will move down 20 lines, and type 20.
Very DECish.  DDT is the debugger, DO is a batch-type command processor. A
sample batch file that will assemble and write out the bootable CP/M image
(on drive A) is "SYSCPM2.SUB".  To run it, type "DO SYSCPM2".

  In order to efficiently transfer files into the CP/M environment use the
included program R <filename.ext>. If you have a file named foo.ext in the
current directory (i.e. the directory where SIMH is), executing R FOO.EXT
under CP/M will transfer the file onto the CP/M disk. Transferring a file
from the CP/M environment to the SIMH environment is accomplished by
W <filename.ext> for text files or by W <filename.ext> B for binary files.
The simplest way for transferring multiple files is to create a ".SUB"
batch file which contains the necessary R resp. W commands.

  If you need more storage space you can use a simulated hard disk on
drives I: and J:. To use do "attach HDSK0 hdi.dsk" and issue the
"XFORMAT I:" resp.  "XFORMAT J:" command from CP/M do initialize the disk
to an empty state.

5.2 CP/M Version 3 with banked memory

  CP/M 3 is the successor to CP/M 2.2. A customized BIOS (BIOS3.MAC) is
included to facilitate modification if so desired. The defaults supplied in
GENCPM.DAT for system generation can be used. BOOTGEN.COM is used to place
the CP/M loader (LDR.COM) on the boot tracks of a disk.

  Running CP/M 3 with banked memory:
  sim> attach dsk cpm3.dsk
  sim> reset cpu
  sim> set cpu banked
  sim> set cpu itrap
  sim> boot dsk

  Executing "DO SYSCPM3" will re-generate the banked version of CP/M 3. You
can boot CP/M 3 with or without a Z80 CPU. The Z80 CPU is needed for both
sysgens due to the use of BOOTGEN.COM which requires it.

The disk "cpm3.dsk" contains the following files:

5.3 MP/M II with banked memory

  MP/M II is an acronym for MultiProgramming Monitor Control Program for
Microprocessors. It is a multiuser operating system for an eight bit
microcomputer. MP/M II supports multiprogramming at each terminal. This
version supports four terminals available via Telnet. To boot:

  sim> attach dsk mpm.dsk
  sim> set cpu itrap
  sim> set cpu z80
  sim> set cpu rom
  sim> set cpu banked
  sim> attach sio 23
  sim> d common b000
  sim> boot dsk

  Now connect a Telnet session to the simulator and type "MPM" at the "A>"
prompt. Now you can connect up to three additional terminals via Telnet to
the Altair running MP/M II. To re-generate the system perform "DO SYSMPM"
in the CP/M environment (not possible under MP/M since XSUB is needed).

6. Special simulator feature: Memory access breakpoints

  In addition to the regular SIMH features such as PC queue, breakpoints
etc., this simulator supports memory access breakpoints. A memory access
breakpoint is triggered when a pre-defined memory location is accessed
(read, write or update). To set a memory location breakpoint enter

sim> break -m <location>

  Execution will stop whenever an operation accesses <location>. Note that
a memory access breakpoint is not triggered by fetching code from memory
(this is the job of regular breakpoints). This feature has been implemented
by using the typing facility of the SIMH breakpoints.


7. Brief summary of all major changes to the original Altair simulator
- Full support for Z80. CP/M software requiring a Z80 CPU now runs
  properly. DDTZ and PROLOGZ are included for demonstration purposes.
- Added banked memory support.
- PC queue implemented.
- Full assembler and dis-assembler support for Z80 and 8080 mnemonics.
  Depending on the current setting of the CPU, the appropriate mnemonics
  are used.
- The BOOT ROM was changed to fully load the software from disk. The
  original code basically loaded a copy of itself from the disk and
  executed it.
- ROM and memory size settings are now fully honored. This means that you
  cannot write into the ROM or outside the defined RAM (e.g. when the RAM size
  was truncated with the SET CPU commands). This feature allows programs which
  check for the size of available RAM to run properly (e.g. 4k Basic). In
  addition one can enable and disable the ROM which is useful in special cases
  (e.g. when testing a new version of the ROM).
- The console can also be used via Telnet. This is useful when a terminal is
  needed which supports cursor control such as a VT100. PROLOGZ for example
  has a built-in screen editor which works under Telnet.
- Simplified file exchange for CP/M. Using the READ program under CP/M one
  can easily import files into CP/M from the regular file system. Note that PIP
  does not work properly on non-text files on PTR.
- The WRITE program can be used to transfer files from the CP/M environment to
  the regular environment (binary or ASCII transfer).
- The last character read from PTR is always Control-Z (the EOF character for
  CP/M). This makes sure that PIP (Peripheral Interchange Program on CP/M) will
  terminate properly.
- Fixed a bug in the BIOS warm boot routine which caused CP/M to crash.
- Modified the BIOS for CP/M to support 8 disks.
- Added CP/M 3 banked version as sample software
- Changed from octal to hex
- Made the DSK and SIO device more robust (previously malicious code could
  crash the simulator)
- Added memory access break points
- Added periodic timer interrupts (useful for MP/M)
- Added additional consoles (useful for MP/M)
- Added MP/M II banked version as sample software
