$! This procedure patches the VMB.EXE provided with VAX/VMS V7.3 to
$! support the Boot Block boot functionality provided on all VAX
$! systems which run a ROM based VMB.

$ PATCH /ABSOLUTE /NEW_VERSION /OUTPUT=cp$exe:VMB.EXE cp$src:VMB_orig.EXE
! The native VMB.EXE program historically supported a Boot Block oriented
! boot if Bit 3 of the parameter register (R5) was set when VMB was invoked.
! This Boot Block boot operation reads sector 0 into memory and starts
! execution at offset 2 of the data block in memory.
! When portitions of VMB were migrated into ROM to support the earliest
! MicroVAX system (MicroVAX I) and all subsequent ROM based VMB versions
! the concept of Boot Block booting was extended in these ROM VMB
! implementations.  The change in boot block booting functionality included
! several features:
!   1) If a normal boot attempt to a device failed (due to VMB not being
!      able to locate a secondary bootstrap program), a boot block boot is
!      automatically attempted.  If the Bit 3 of R5 was set, then the
!      initial search for a secondary boot block was avoided and a boot
!      block boot was immediately attempted.
!   2) When performing a boot block boot, the sector 0 contents are examined
!      and if these contents conform to the pattern defined for ROM based
!      (PRA0) booting, the ROM format Offset, Size, and Starting address
!      information is used directly by VMB to load a program into memory
!      and control is transferred to that program.  If the contents of
!      sector 0 do not fit the pattern required for ROM based booting, then
!      the code in sector 0 is executed directly starting at offset 2,
!      the same as was originally done with the non ROM based VMB versions.
!      Note that this extended behavior allows sector 0 to contain very little
!      information and quite possibly no actual boot code.
! Developers of alternate operating systems for VAX computers noticed the ROM
! based boot block behavior and changed their installation media AND the disk
! structures to only provide the minimal boot information required on the
! systems with VMB installed in ROM.
!
! Since, when this active development of these alternate operating systems for
! VAX computers was happening, the vast majority of development and new system
! deployments were to hardware which had ROM base VMB, no one noticed that
! older systems which booted with the non ROM based VMB could no longer boot
! from new install media or disks formatted with these operating systems.
!
! This patch addeds the ROM based VMB boot block boot functionality to the
! original dynamically loaded VMB.EXE used by the older systems to boot.
!
! The patch overwrites some VMB code which exists to support NVAX(1302) and
! Neon-V(1701) systems.  If simh simulators for these systems are ever built
! an alternate location must be found to accomodate this extended logic
!
