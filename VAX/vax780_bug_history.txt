Bugs Found And Fixed During Simulator Debug

1. RP: drive clear does not clear RPDA.
2. TU: default formatter must be TM03.
3. SBI: drive 'letter' is actually a 1-based number.
4. MBA: drive register reads return SR<31:16> as high word.
5. UBA: DMA addresses must be masked to Unibus width (18b).
6. HK: thread used multiple times if SEEK is followed by NOP or DCLR.
7. HK: only DCLR clears ATA.
8. MEM: MS780E size declaration off-by-1.
9. MEM: MS780E array start off by >> 4.
10. MEM: CSR-C register write logic incorrect.
11. CIS: CMPP3/CMPP4 using wrong arguments to ReadDstr.
12. CPU, OCTA: CVTfi with integer overflow not setting trap if PSW<iv> = 1.
13. STDDEV: read of ICR was missing the call parameter.
14. ACBD/G: testing wrong operand register to get limit sign.
15. CPU: faults not clearing PSL<tp>.
16. ADAWI: register mode implemented incorrectly.
17. MOVTC: condition codes not preserved through page fault.
18. MOVTUC: condition codes not preserved through page fault.
19. MOVTUC: escape tested against untranslated rather than translated character.
20. CVTPT: condition code and decimal overflow calculation incorrect.
21. CVTPS: condition code and decimal overflow calculation incorrect.
22. CVTPL: if destination is register, result is stored after register updates.
23. CVTPL: integer overflow set <C> rather than <V>.
24. all decimal string: 11/780 does not validate characters in decimal strings.
25. EDITPC: condition codes not preserved through page fault.
26. EDITPC EO$INSERT: inserts sign instead of fill.
27. EDITPC EO$BLANK_ZERO: address off by one.
28. EDITPC EO$BLANK_ZERO: not testing for <C> set.
29. EDITPC EO$LOAD_PLUS: not skipping character if test fails.
30. EDITPC EO$LOAD_MINUS: not skipping character if test fails.
31. Compatibility mode: SXT not implemented.
32. Compatibility mode: XOR operands fetched in wrong order.
33. MNEGH: condition codes set from original sign.
34. MNEGH: <C> not cleared.
35. H_floating quad precision integer routines (add, inc, neg): carry propagation incorrect.
36. H_floating packup routines: test for zero used exponent not fraction.
37. MULH: carries out of floating accumulator lost.
38. DIVH: stores wrong operand as result.
39. POLYF/D/G: truncation after add not needed.
40. POLYF/D/G: early SRM requires truncation to 31b/63b, not 32b/64b.
41. POLYF/D/G/H: exits too early if argument is zero.
42. POLYD/G/H: calculates address of residual pointer result incorrectly.
43. POLYD/G: performs single precision rather than double precision multiply.
44. POLYH: fails to truncate intermediate result from 128b to 127b.
45. POLYF/D/G/H: internal add routine must test fraction rather than exponent to
    detect zero, POLYx can create "denormalized" intermediate result.
46. EMODH: concatenate 16b of extension operand instead of 15b.
47. Specifier flows: modify flows testing for read access rather than write access.
48. Quad/octa writes: wrong address reported on faulting cross-page writes.
49. Memory management: 11/780 implements access control test on first level PTE's.
50. LDPCTX: 11/780 implements mbz tests on PCB fields.
51. LDPCTX/MTPR: 11/780 validity checks PCBB, SCBB, SBR, SLR, P0BR, P0LR, P1BR, P1LR.
52. TMR: tmr_inc not updated in standard (100Hz) mode.
53. MTPR SBR/PCBB/SCBB: 11/780 only checks that bits<1:0> == 0.
54. MTPR xLR: 11/780 excludes bits<31:24> from mbz test.
55. MTPR PxBR: 11/780 only checks bits<31,1:0> == 1,00.
56. EMODx: integer overflow case requiring left shift returns wrong result.
57. BPT, XFC: not clearing PSL<tp> before taking exception.
58. POLYx: add step <does> require truncation (proved by AXE tests).
59. Unaligned references to IO space: incorrect on CVAX.
60. REI to compatibility mode: PSL<dv,fu,iv> were not checked for mbz.
61. Indexed immediate not does fault.
