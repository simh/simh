   This is the standard card reader.
   This is the standard card punch.

   Input formats are accepted in a variaty of formats:
        Standard ASCII: one record per line.
                returns are ignored.
                tabs are expanded to modules 8 characters.
                ~ in first column is treated as a EOF.

        Binary Card format:
                Each record 160 characters.
                First character   21012345
                                  111
                Second characters 6789----
                Top 4 bits of second character are 0.
                It is unlikely that ascii text or BCD format
                text could produce similar profile.

        BCD Format:
                Each record variable length (80 chars or less).
                Record mark has bit 7 set.
                Bit 6 is even parity.
                Bits 5-0 are character.

        CBN Format:
                Each record 160 charaters.
                First char has bit 7 set. Rest set to 0.
                Bit 6 is odd parity.
                Bit 5-0 of first character are top 6 bits
                        of card.
                Bit 5-0 of second character are lower 6 bits
                        of card.

    For autodetection of BCD card format, there can be no parity errors.
    All undeterminate formats are treated as ASCII.

    ASCII mode recognizes some additional forms of input which allows the
    intermixing of binary cards with text cards. 

    Lines beginning with ~raw are taken as a number of 4 digit octal values
    with represent each column of the card from 12 row down to 9 row. If there
    is not enough octal numbers to span a full card the remainder of the 
    card will not be punched.

    Also ~eor, will generate a 7/8/9 punch card. An ~eof will gernerate a
    6/7/9 punch card, and a ~eoi will generate a 6/7/8/9 punch.

    A single line of ~ will set the EOF flag when that card is read.

    Auto output format is ASCII if card has only printable characters
    or card format binary.
