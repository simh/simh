   The HP 3000 Memory Subsystem is an integral part of the 3000 computer.
   Replacing the core memory used in the earlier 3000 CX machines, the Series II
   introduced an all-semiconductor memory using 4K NMOS RAMs that provided error
   detection and correction.  Single-bit errors are corrected automatically, and
   double-bit errors are detected.  All errors are logged in hardware, and the
   logs are downloaded periodically by MPE to allow preventative maintenance and
   replacement of failing parts.

   The Series II supports a main memory size of 64K to 256K words in 32K
   increments.  It uses four types of memory PCAs:

     - 30007-60002 MCL (Memory Control and Logging, up to 128K words)
     - 30008-60002 SMA (Semiconductor Memory Array, 32K words, 17 bits)
     - 30009-60001 FCA (Fault Correction Array, up to 128K words, 4 bits)
     - 30009-60002 FLI (Fault Logging Interface, up to 256K words)

   A 64K system uses one of each PCA.  A 256K system uses 2 MCLs, 8 SMAs, 2 FCAs
   and 1 FLI.  Five check bits (one on the SMA, four on the FCA) are used.

   The Series III supports a main memory size of 128K to 1024K words in 128K
   increments using 16K RAMs.  It uses three types of memory PCAs:

     - 30007-60005 MCL (Memory Control and Logging, up to 512K words)
     - 30008-60003 SMA (Semiconductor Memory Array, 128K words, 22 bits)
     - 30009-60002 FLI (Fault Logging Interface, up to 1024K words)

   A 128K system uses one of each PCA.  A 1024K system uses 2 MCLs, 8 SMAs, and
   1 FLI.  Six check bits (all on the SMA) are used.  The standalone FLI PCA may
   be replaced with a 30135-60063 System Clock/Fault Logging Interface that
   combines both devices on a single PCA.

   Main memory consists of from one to eight 128K word memory arrays.  Memory is
   divided into two 512K modules, each with its own Module Control Unit and
   Memory Control and Logging PCA.  The two modules respond to module numbers 0
   and 1 or 2 and 3.

   Error correction is implemented by storing five (Series II) or six (Series
   III) check bits with the sixteen data bits.  The Series III check bits
   reflect the parity of sets of eight data bits, as follows:

     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 C0 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 Parity

   The check bits are generated by setting C0-C5 to zero.  When read, the parity
   computations (syndrome) will result in all zeros if the data and check bits
   are correct and non-zero values if one or more bits are in error.  If a
   single bit (either data or check) is in error, the syndrome itself will have
   odd parity and will indicate the bit in error as indicated above.  If the
   syndrome is non-zero and has even parity, i.e., does not contain either one
   or three 1-bits, then a double-bit error has occurred, and the syndrome value
   is not significant.

   The MCL will correct single-bit data errors (single-bit check errors need not
   be corrected).  Double-bit errors will result in data parity interrupts.

   Each MCL contains one 1024 x 1 static RAM ELA (Error Logging Array).  The
   array stores a 1 in an address corresponding to the 4K or 16K RAM chip
   containing the bit in error.  The address is 10 bits wide, consisting of a
   5-bit chip-row address (2-bit SMA PCA address and 3-bit row address) and a
   5-bit bit-in-error code (the lower five bits of the 6-bit ECC syndrome).  The
   bit-in-error code is decoded as:

     Code  Bit   Code  Bit   Code  Bit   Code  Bit

      07   D0     17   --     27   --     37   --

     *  Forced double-error write
     ** Missing SMA

   If a parity error occurs on the data sent from the MCU to the SMA for a
   write, the MCL asserts a data parity error (CPX1.6) and forces a double-bit
   error into the check bits by complementing the C3 and C5 bits.  This ensures
   that a read of the location will always cause a data parity error interrupt.
   If an addressed SMA is not present, the all-zeros data and check bits result
   in a syndrome of 12, due to the odd parity of the C2 and C4 calculations.


   Main memory is simulated by allocating an array of MEMORY_WORDs large enough
   to accommodate the largest system configuration (1024 KW).  Array access is
   then restricted to the configured size; accesses beyond the end of configured
   memory result in an Illegal Address interrupt.

   All accesses to main memory are through exported functions.  Examine and
   deposit routines provide for SCP interfacing, and general read and write
   routines are used by the other HP 3000 simulator modules.  Each general
   access carries an access classification that determines how memory will be
   addressed.  Program, data, and stack accesses use their respective memory
   bank registers to form the indices into the simulated memory array.  DMA
   accesses on behalf of the multiplexer and selector channels use the memory
   banks supplied by the channel programs.  Absolute accesses imply bank number
   zero.

   Several auxiliary functions provide memory initialization, filling, and
   checking that a specified range of memory has not been used.  A full set of
   byte-access routines is provided to emulate byte addressing on the
   word-addressable HP 3000.

   The memory simulator provides the capability to trace memory reads and
   writes, as well as byte and BCD operands that are stored in memory.  Three
   general memory debug flags are defined and can be used by the other simulator
   modules to trace memory reads and writes, instruction fetches, and operand
   accesses.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Error detection and correction is not currently simulated.

/* Read a word from memory.

   Read and return a word from memory at the indicated offset and implied bank.
   If the access succeeds, the routine returns TRUE.  If the accessed word is
   outside of physical memory, the Illegal Address interrupt flag is set for
   CPU accesses, the value is set to 0, and the routine returns FALSE.  If
   access checking is requested, and the check fails, a Bounds Violation trap is
   taken.

   On entry, "dptr" points to the DEVICE structure of the device requesting
   access, "classification" is the type of access requested, "offset" is a
   logical offset into the memory bank implied by the access classification,
   except for absolute and DMA accesses, for which "offset" is a physical
   address, and "value" points to the variable to receive the memory content.

   Memory accesses other than DMA accesses may be checked or unchecked.  Checked
   program, data, and stack accesses must specify locations within the
   corresponding segments (PB <= ea <= PL for program, or DL <= ea <= S for data
   or stack) unless the CPU in is privileged mode, and those that reference the
   TOS locations return values from the TOS registers instead of memory.
   Checked absolute accesses return TOS location values if referenced but
   otherwise access memory directly with no additional restrictions.

   For data and stack accesses, there are three cases, depending on the
   effective address:

     - EA >= DL and EA <= SM : read from memory

     - EA > SM and EA <= SM + SR : read from a TOS register if bank = stack bank

     - EA < DL or EA > SM + SR : trap if not privileged, else read from memory


   Implementation notes:

    1. The physical address is formed by merging the bank and offset without
       masking either value to their respective register sizes.  Masking is not
       necessary, as it was done when the bank registers were loaded, and it is
       faster to avoid it.  Primarily, though, it is not done so that an invalid
       bank register value (e.g., loaded from a corrupted stack) will generate
       an illegal address interrupt and so will pinpoint the problem for
       debugging.

    2. In hardware, bounds checking is performed explicitly by microcode.  In
       simulation, bounds checking is performed explicitly by employing the
       "_checked" versions of the desired access classifications.

/* Write a word to memory.

   Write a word to memory at the indicated offset and implied bank.  If the
   write succeeds, the routine returns TRUE.  If the accessed location is outside
   of physical memory, the Illegal Address interrupt flag is set for CPU
   accesses, the write is ignored, and the routine returns FALSE.  If access
   checking is requested, and the check fails, a Bounds Violation trap is taken.

   For data and stack accesses, there are three cases, depending on the
   effective address:

     - EA >= DL and EA <= SM + SR : write to memory

     - EA > SM and EA <= SM + SR : write to a TOS register if bank = stack bank

     - EA < DL or EA > SM + SR : trap if not privileged, else write to memory

   Note that cases 1 and 2 together imply that a write to a TOS register also
   writes through to the underlying memory.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The physical address is formed by merging the bank and offset without
       masking either value to their respective register sizes.  Masking is not
       necessary, as it was done when the bank registers were loaded, and it is
       faster to avoid it.  Primarily, though, it is not done so that an invalid
       bank register value (e.g., loaded from a corrupted stack) will generate
       an illegal address interrupt and so will pinpoint the problem for
       debugging.

    2. In hardware, bounds checking is performed explicitly by microcode.  In
       simulation, bounds checking is performed explicitly by employing the
       "_checked" versions of the desired access classifications.

    3. The Series II microcode shows that only the STOR and STD instructions
       write through to memory when the effective address is in a TOS register.
       However, in simulation, all (checked) stack and data writes will write
       through.

   The supplied byte accessor structure is initialized for the starting relative

   ending word addresses are bounds-checked, and a Bounds Violation will occur
   if the address range exceeds that permitted by the access.  If the block
   length is zero and checked accesses are requested, then only the starting
   address is checked, and it is the caller's responsibility to check additional
   accesses as they occur.

   The byte access routines assume that if the initial range or starting address
   is checked, succeeding accesses need not be checked, and vice versa.  The
   implication is that if the access class passed to this routine is checked,
   the routine might abort with a Bounds Violation, but succeeding read or write
   accesses will not, and if the class is unchecked, this routine will not abort
   but a succeeding access might.

   routines.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Calling mem_set_byte with the initial_byte_address field set to zero
       indicates an initialization call that should use the count field as the
       block length.  Zero is not a valid value for initial_byte_address, as
       memory location 0 is reserved for the code segment table pointer.

       Entry with initial_byte_address non-zero indicates that the count field
       contains the number of bytes read or written since initialization.

    2. The operand extents are updated only if an access was made with the
       current accessor.  This avoids extending the bounds if the accessor was
       set but never used to read or write a byte.

    3. The class field contains the access class used when reading or writing
       bytes.  The initial access check uses the opposite sense.
