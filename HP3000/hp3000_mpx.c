   The HP 30036B Multiplexer Channel provides high-speed data transfer between
   from one to sixteen devices and main memory.  Concurrent transfers for
   multiple devices are multiplexed on a per-word basis, dependent on the
   service request priorities assigned to the participating interfaces.
   Interfaces must have additional hardware to be channel-capable, as the
   channel uses separate control and data signals from those used for direct
   I/O.  In addition, the multiplexer and selector channels differ somewhat in
   their use of the signals, so interfaces are generally designed for use with
   one or the other (the Selector Channel Maintenance Board is a notable
   exception that uses jumpers to indicate which channel to use).

   The transfer rate of the Series III multiplexer channel is poorly documented.
   Various rates are quoted in different publications: a uniform 990 KB/second
   rate in one, a 1038 KB/second inbound rate and a 952 KB/second outbound rate
   in another.  Main memory access time is given as 300 nanoseconds, and the
   cycle time is 700 nanoseconds.  The multiplexer channel passes data to and
   from main memory via the I/O Processor.

   Once started by an SIO instruction, the channel executes I/O programs
   independently of the CPU.  Program words are read, and device status is
   written back, by calls to the I/O Processor.

   32-bit I/O program words are formed from a 16-bit I/O control word (IOCW) and
   a 16-bit I/O address word (IOAW) in this general format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | C |   order   | X |       control word 1/word count           |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                 control word 2/status/address                 |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Most orders are fully decoded by bits 1-3, but a few use bit 4 to extend the
   definition where bits 4-15 are not otherwise used.  I/O programs always
   reside in memory bank 0.  The current I/O program pointer resides in word 0
   of the Device Reference Table entry for the active interface.

   The Jump and Jump Conditional orders use this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   0   0 | C | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                      jump target address                      |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   ...where C is 0 for an unconditional jump and 1 for a conditional jump.  An
   unconditional jump is handled entirely within the channel.  A conditional
   jump asserts the SETJMP signal to the interface.  If the interface returns
   JMPMET, the jump will occur; otherwise, execution continues with the next
   program word.

   The Return Residue order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   0   1   0 | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                     residue of word count                     |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The remaining word count from the last transfer will be returned in the IOAW
   as a two's-complement value.  If the transfer completed normally, the
   returned value will be zero.

   The Set Bank order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   0   1   1 | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |     bank      |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   This establishes the memory bank to be used for subsequent Write or Read
   orders.  Program addresses always use bank 0.

   The Interrupt order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   1   0 | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The SETINT signal is asserted to the interface for this order.

   The End and End with Interrupt orders use this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   1   1 | I | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                         device status                         |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   ...where I is 0 for an End and 1 for an End with Interrupt.  The PSTATSTB
   signal is asserted to the interface to obtain the device status, which is
   stored in the IOAW location.  If the I bit is set, SETINT will also be
   asserted,

   The Control order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 1   0   0 |                control word 1                 |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                        control word 2                         |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Both control words are sent to the interface.  The full IOCW containing
   control word 1 is sent with the PCMD1 signal asserted.  It is followed by the
   IOAW with PCONTSTB asserted.

   The Sense order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 1   0   1 | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                         device status                         |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The PSTATSTB signal is asserted to the interface to obtain the device status,
   which is stored in the IOAW location.

   The Write and Read orders use these formats:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | C | 1   1   0 |         negative word count to write          |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | C | 1   1   1 |          negative word count to read          |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                       transfer address                        |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The C bit is the "data chain" flag.  If it is set, then this transfer is a
   continuation of a previous Write or Read transfer.  This is used to
   circumvent the transfer size limitation inherent in the 12-bit word count
   allocated in the IOCW.  For single transfers larger than 4K words, multiple
   contiguous Write or Read orders are used, with all but the last order having
   their data chain bits set.

   In simulation, IOCW bits 1-4 are used to index into a 16-element lookup table
   to produce the final I/O order (because some of the orders define IOCW bit 4
   as "don't care", there are only thirteen distinct orders).

   Channel-capable interfaces connect via the multiplexer channel bus and
   request channel service by asserting one of the sixteen Service Request
   signals (SR0 through SR15).  Jumpers on the interface establish which SR
   number to use.  When multiple devices request service simultaneously, the
   channel grants access to the lowest-numbered request.

   In simulation, an interface is connected to the channel by setting the
   "service_request" field in the DIB to a value between 0 and 15, representing
   the SR number signal to assert.  If the field is set to the SRNO_UNUSED
   value, then it is not connected to the channel.


   The channel contains a diagnostic interface that provides the capability to
   check the operation independently of channel program execution.  The
   interface responds to direct I/O instructions, as follows:

   Control Word Format (CIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | M | - |  RAM address  | A | O | S | L | I | -   -   -   -   - |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     M  = master reset
     A  = select the Address RAM and Register
     O  = select the Order RAM and Register
     S  = select the State RAM and Register
     L  = load the registers from the RAMs during the next read
     I  = increment the Address or Word Count Registers after the next read

   The control word establishes the address and enable(s) to read or write from
   a given RAM location.  The RAM address is stored in the control word register
   and is used in lieu of the service request encoding whenever an I/O order
   references the multiplexer device number, effectively providing a
   programmable service request number.  The A/O/S/L/I bits enable the
   corresponding actions for the next WIO or RIO instruction.


   Status Word Format (TIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | S | D | - | E |  RAM address  | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

     Key:

       S = SIO OK (always 0)
       D = direct read/write I/O OK (always 1)
       E = a state parity error exists

   A state parity error occurs when the state register contains a value other
   than one of the four defined states.  An error causes the RAM address and E
   bit to be stored in the error register, which is then gated to form the
   status return value.  The error register is cleared by an IORESET or master
   reset.


   Write Word Format (WIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                            address                            |  Address RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |     order     |                  word count                   |  Order RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   - | A | B | C | D | -   -   -   -   -   - |  bank number  |  State RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     A = set the state to State A
     B = set the state to State B
     C = set the state to State C
     D = set the state to State D

   The address, order, or state RAM value is written to the specified register
   and RAM address set by the last control word.  If multiple registers/RAMs
   were selected, then the value is written to all of them.

   Setting more than one state bit at a time will generate a state parity error.


   Read Word Format (RIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                            address                            |  Address RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |     order     |                  word count                   |  Order RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   - |  bank number  | T | A | B | C | D | E | P | S |  State RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     T = the transfer complete flip-flop value
     A = the state is State A
     B = the state is State B
     C = the state is State C
     D = the state is State D
     E = the end-of-transfer flip-flop value
     P = address parity (odd parity for the address register)
     S = a state parity error exists

   The diagnostic tests address parity and state parity.  State parity also
   asserts the XFERERROR signal, which aborts a transfer in progress.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The multiplexer channel must execute more than one I/O order per CPU
       instruction in order to meet the timing requirements of the diagnostic.
       The timing is modeled by establishing a count of channel clock pulses at
       poll entry and then executing orders until the count is exhausted.  If
       the clock count was exceeded, the excess count is saved and then
       subtracted from the next entry's count, so that the typical execution
       time is preserved over a number of entries.

/* Program constants.

   The multiplexer channel clock period is 175 nanoseconds.  The channel runs
   concurrently with the CPU, which executes instructions in an average of
   2.57 microseconds, so multiple cycles are executed per CPU instruction.

   In simulation, the channel is called from the instruction execution loop
   after every instruction, and sometimes additionally within instructions that
   have long execution times (e.g., MOVE).  The number of event ticks that have
   elapsed since the last call are passed to the channel; this determines the
   number of channel cycles to execute.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The number of cycles consumed by the channel for various operations are
       educated guesses.  There is no documentation available that details the
       cycle timing.

    2. The MPX_STATE values match the values supplied in bits 2-5 of the "write
       state RAM" command.

    3. State "parity" is 1 for an illegal state and 0 for a valid state.

/* Channel RAMs.

   In hardware, control information for a transfer-in-progress is stored in one
   of sixteen RAM locations, corresponding the to assigned service request
   number.  The RAM is 42 bits wide, partitioned as follows:

     - a 4-bit state RAM
     - a 6-bit auxiliary RAM
     - a 16-bit address RAM
     - a 16-bit order RAM

   In simulation, the 16-bit order RAM is split into a 5-bit order RAM and a
   12-bit counter RAM.  The order RAM stores the Data Chain bit and the four-bit
   translated SIO order, rather than the DC and three-bit basic channel order.
   This allows direct interpretation of the I/O order, rather than sometimes
   depending on the leading bit of the counter RAM.

   Values within the RAMs are formatted as follows:

       0   1 | 2   3   4 | 5   6   7
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   - |     state     |  State RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   - | B | T |     bank      |  Auxiliary RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   - | C |     order     |  Order RAM
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     B = the transfer is within a block
     T = the terminal word count has been reached
     C = the I/O order specifies data chaining

   Implementation notes:

    1. SCP requires that arrayed register elements be sized to match their width
       in bits.  We want to display multiplexer state RAM entries as four-bit
       values, so state_ram must have 8-bit elements.  However, because the
       MPX_STATE enum size is implementation-dependent, state_ram cannot be of
       type MPX_STATE.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The "mpx_request_set" and "srs" variables need not be SAVEd or RESTOREd,
       as they are rebuilt during the instruction execution prelude.

    2. The state RAM register array cannot be named "STATE", because SCP uses
       "STATE" to display all of the registers, and it checks the keyword before
       checking for a register of the same name.

/* Start an I/O program.

   This routine is called by a device interface in response to a Start I/O (SIO)
   instruction to request that the multiplexer channel begin an I/O program.  It
   corresponds in hardware to asserting the REQ signal.

   On entry, the service request number from the device's DIB is used as the RAM
   index.  The state RAM entry corresponding to the SR number is set to State C,
   and the other RAM entries are cleared.  The count of active I/O programs is
   incremented.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Setting "excess_cycles" to the negative number of cycles per event
       effectively doubles the available state execution time of the first
       multiplexer poll.  This is necessary to pass the Stand-Alone HP 30115A
       (7970B/E) Magnetic Tape Diagnostic (D433) steps 252, 255, 260, and 263,
       which check for command rejects.  The diagnostic does an SIO / BNE / TIO
       sequence and expects reject status to be set.  However, the two available
       multiplexer state execution opportunities (between the instructions) are
       insufficient to execute the C, A, and B states that are necessary for the
       tape controller to reject the command.  We therefore lengthen the first
       opportunity, so that all three states are completed before the TIO
       instruction checks for command reject.

/* Request channel service.

   This routine is called by a device interface to request service from the

   needed for asynchronous assertion, e.g., in response to an event service
   call.  Synchronous assertion, i.e., in response to an interface call, is made
   by returning the SRn signal to the IOP.  The routine corresponds in hardware
   to asserting the SRn signal associated with the interface to the multiplexer.

   On entry, the service_request field in the device's DIB is set to TRUE, and
   the request set bit corresponding the service_request_number field in the DIB
   is set.  This enables the channel to service the interface on the next
   multiplexer poll call, assuming that the interface has priority.

/* Poll the interfaces on the multiplexer channel bus for service requests.

   This routine is called in the CPU instruction execution loop to service a
   request from the highest-priority device interface.  It corresponds in
   hardware to asserting HSREQ to the IOP, receiving the DATAPOLL IN signal from
   the IOP, and then denying DATAPOLL OUT to the next multiplexer channel in the
   chain.  It executes one or more channel cycles for the associated device
   interface and resets the service request flag in the DIB.

   The multiplexer channel clock period is 175 nanoseconds.  The channel runs
   concurrently with the CPU, which executes instructions in an average of
   2.57 microseconds, so multiple cycles are executed per CPU instruction.

   This routine is called after every instruction, and sometimes additionally
   within instructions that have long execution times (e.g., MOVE).  The number
   of event ticks that have elapsed since the last call are passed in; this
   determines the number of channel cycles available to execute.

   In hardware, the multiplexer priority-encodes the 16 service request lines,
   selecting the highest-priority request for servicing.  In simulation, a
   service request sets the request set bit corresponding to the SR number.
   When a poll is performed, the device corresponding to the highest-priority
   (lowest-order) bit will be the recipient of the current multiplexer channel
   cycles.

   On entry, the routine determines the highest-priority interface that is
   requesting service and then executes the next state in the transfer for that
   interface, based on the values in the RAM.  The number of multiplexer clock
   counts consumed for the specified state execution is subtracted from the
   number of clock counts available.  If more time remains, and one or more
   service requests are still active, another channel cycle is run for
   the (possibly different) interface.

   The multiplexer obtains the current state from the State RAM entry
   corresponding to the service request number.  If the current state is
   invalid, i.e., not one of the four defined states, the channel aborts the
   transfer by asserting XFERERROR to the interface.  Otherwise, control
   branches to one of the four state handlers before returning.

   A transfer can be in one of four defined states:

     - State A: fetch the first word (IOCW) of the I/O program word
     - State B: fetch or store the second word (IOAW) of the I/O program word
     - State C: fetch or store the I/O program pointer (IOPP)
     - State D: transfer data to or from the interface

   All I/O orders except Set Bank, Read, and Write execute states C, A, and B,
   in that order.  The Set Bank order executes state C, A, and D.  The Read and
   Write orders execute states C, A, B, and then one D state for each word
   transferred.  Some actions are dependent on external signals (JMPMET or
   DEVEND) or internal conditions (terminal count reached [TC] or in a chained
   block transfer [IB]).

   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, IOCW bits 1-3 specify the I/O order, except that the Jump,
       End, Return Residue, and Set Bank orders require an additional bit (IOCW
       bit 4) to define their orders fully.  In simulation, the IOCW_ORDER macro
       uses IOCW bits 0-4 as an index into a 32-element lookup table to produce
       the final I/O order (because some of the orders define IOCW bit 4 as
       "don't care", there are only thirteen distinct orders).

    2. In hardware, the Interrupt order loads the address register with the
       (unused) IOAW value.  The simulator maintains this behavior.

    3. The word count rollover flip-flop is preset asynchronously by the carry
       out signal from the word counter and is cleared synchronously by the
       trailing edge of the write-to-RAMs signal at the end of each state.  It
       is used by the next-state logic to decide whether to remain in State D or
       exit to State C.

    4. In hardware, the Device End flip-flop is clocked at the beginning and end
       of every I/O cycle and samples the DEVEND signal from the interface.  The
       output controls the state sequencer.  In simulation, the flip-flop is
       cleared at the end of every cycle, which ensures that it's clear for the
       next cycle entry.

    5. The default label in the State B switch statement is necessary to quiet a
       warning that "inbound_signals" may be used uninitialized, even though all
       cases are covered.  The initialization of "outbound" is also necessary,
       even though all paths through the while statement set its value.

/* Multiplexer channel diagnostic interface.

   The channel diagnostic interface is installed on the IOP bus and receives
   direct I/O commands from the IOP.  It does not respond to programmed I/O
   (SIO) commands, nor does it interrupt.

   In simulation, the asserted signals on the bus are represented as bits in the
   inbound_signals set.  Each signal is processed sequentially in numerical
   order, and a set of similar outbound_signals is assembled and returned to the
   caller, simulating assertion of the corresponding bus signals.

   The interface allows a program to write to and read from any desired address
   in the address, order, state, or auxiliary RAMs.  A CIO instruction specifies
   the RAM address and register to write or read with a subsequent WIO or RIO
   instruction.  In addition, the address and word count registers may be
   incremented and the resulting values tested for correctness.  After the RAMs
   are written, the next state is computed and written to the state RAM.
   Reading this value allows the next-state logic to be checked.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, IOCW bits 1-3 specify the I/O order, except that the Jump,
       End, Return Residue, and Set Bank orders require an additional bit (IOCW
       bit 4) to define their orders fully.  In simulation, the IOCW_ORDER macro
       uses IOCW bits 0-4 as an index into a 32-element lookup table to produce
       the final I/O order (because some of the orders define IOCW bit 4 as
       "don't care", there are only thirteen distinct orders).

    2. In hardware, the "select the Address RAM and Register" bit (bit 6) of the
       control word is used only to enable reading and incrementing.  The
       address RAM is written by a WIO instruction if the "select the Order RAM
       and Register" bit (bit 7) is not set.  If bit 7 is set, then the Order
       RAM is written.

    3. A WIO instruction writes all of the RAMs simultaneously.  The control
       word select bits simply determine whether RAM data comes from the output
       word or the corresponding register.

    4. A RIO instruction with the "load the registers from the RAMs during the
       next read" bit (bit 9) of the control word set loads all registers
       simultaneously.  If the load bit and the "increment the Address or Word
       Count Registers after the next read" bit (bit 10) are both set, the load
       overrides the increment.  An enabled increment occurs after the current
       value is returned.

    5. If multiple registers are enabled in the control word, an RIO instruction
       will return the logical OR of the several values (in hardware, the
       selected registers are enabled to the active-low IOD bus).
