   The 13037 multiple-access disc controller (MAC) connects from one to eight HP
   7905 (15 MB), 7906 (20 MB), 7920 (50 MB), or 7925 (120 MB) disc drives to
   interfaces installed in from one to eight HP 1000, 2000, or 3000 CPUs.  The
   drives use a common command set and present data to the controller
   synchronously at a data rate of 468.75 kilowords per second (2.133
   microseconds per word).

   The controller hardware consists of three PCAs: a 16-bit microprogrammed
   processor constructed from 74S181 bit slices operating at 5 MHz, a device
   controller that provides the interconnections to the drives and CPU
   interfaces, and an error correction controller that enables the correction of
   up to 32-bit error bursts.  1024 words of 24-bit firmware are stored in ROM
   on the error correction PCA, and the execution time is 200 nanoseconds per
   instruction.

   The Integrated Controller Drive (ICD) models include the HP 7906H, 7920H, and
   7925H.  These drives are identical to the corresponding MAC drives, except
   that they integrate a single-CPU version of the MAC controller on two PCAs
   housed within the drive: an 8-bit microprocessor constructed from two 4-bit
   slices operating at 3.75 MHz, and an 8-bit DMA that handles the data path
   between the drive and CPU.  Connection to the CPU is via the Hewlett-Packard
   Interface Bus (HP-IB) -- HP's implementation of the IEEE-488 standard.

   The ICD command set essentially is the MAC command set modified for
   single-unit operation.  The unit number and CPU hold bit fields in the opcode
   words are unused in the ICD implementation.  The Load TIO Register, Wakeup,
   and Request Syndrome commands are removed, as Load TIO is used with the HP
   3000, Wakeup is used in a multi-CPU environment, and the simpler ICD
   controller does not support ECC.  Controller status values 02B (Unit
   Available) and 27B (Unit Unavailable) are dropped as the controller supports
   only single units, 12B (I/O Program Error) is reused to indicate HP-IB
   protocol errors, 13B (Sync Not Received) is added, and 17B (Possibly
   Correctable Data Error) is removed as error correction is not supported.

   Some minor redefinitions also occur.  For example, status 14B (End of
   Cylinder) is expanded to include an auto-seek beyond the drive limits, and
   37B (Drive Attention) is restricted to just head unloads (from head loads and
   unloads).

   The MAC controller offers an HP-IB option: the HP 12745A Disc Controller to
   HP-IB Adapter Kit.  This card plugs into the 13037's chassis containing the
   other three controller cards and connects to the CPU interface port of the
   device controller PCA in place of the multi-CPU-interface cable.  It allows
   HP-IB 3000s and the HP 64000 Logic Development Station to connect to MAC disc
   drives; the ICD drives are not supported on these systems.

   This library provides the common functions required by HP disc controllers.
   It implements the 13037 MAC and 13365 ICD controller command sets used with
   the 7905/06/20/25 and 7906H/20H/25H disc drives.

   The library is an adaptation of the code originally written by Bob Supnik
   for the HP2100 DS simulator.  DS simulates a 13037 controller connected via a
   13175 disc interface to an HP 1000 computer.  To create the library, the
   functions of the controller were separated from the functions of the
   interface.  This allows the library to work with other CPU interfaces, such
   as the 12821A HP-IB disc interface, that use substantially different
   communication protocols.  The library functions implement the controller
   command set for the drive units.  The interface functions handle the transfer
   of commands and data to and from the CPU.

   The original release of this library did not handle the data transfer between
   the controller and the interface directly.  Instead, data was moved between
   the interface and a sector buffer by the interface simulator, and then the
   buffer was passed to the disc library for reading or writing.  This buffer
   was also used to pass disc commands and parameters to the controller, and to
   receive status information from the controller.

   While this approach served to allow the library to be shared between
   dissimilar interfaces, each interface had to have intimate knowledge of the
   internal controller state in order to schedule parameter and data transfers.
   In particular, the unit service routine had to base its actions on specific
   controller phase and opcode pairs and manipulate the internal state variables
   of the controller.  As such, the library could not be viewed opaquely.

   In addition, the HP 3000 interface required channel program support that was
   not provided by the simulation library although it was present in hardware.
   Adapting the existing library model would have placed an even larger and more
   intimate burden on the interface simulation.

   As a result, the library API was rewritten to model the hardware more
   closely and provide a more strict separation of controller and interface
   functions.  Instead of providing separate routines to prepare, start, and end
   commands, service units, and poll drives for Attention status, the new model
   provides a single routine that represents the hardware data, flag, and
   function buses between the interface and controller.  The interface calls
   this routine whenever the state of the flag bus changes, and the controller
   responds by potentially changing the data and function buses.  The interface
   merely responds to those changes without requiring any other knowledge of the
   internal state of the controller.


   A device interface simulator interacts with the disc controller simulator via
   the dl_controller routine, which simulates the command, status, and data
   interconnection between the interface and controller.  Utility routines are
   also provided to attach and detach disc image files from drive units, load or
   unload the drive's heads, set drive model and protection status, select the
   interface timing mode (real or fast), and enable overriding of disc command
   status returns for diagnostics.

   In hardware, the interface and controller are interconnected via a 16-bit
   bidirectional data bus (IBUS), a 6-bit flag bus and one signal (CLEAR) to
   the controller, and a 4-bit function bus (IFNBUS) and four signals (ENID,
   ENIR, IFVLD, and IFCLK) to the interface.  The interface initiates controller
   action by changing the state of the flag bus, and the controller responds by
   asserting a function on the function bus.  For example, the interface starts
   a disc command by asserting CMRDY on the flag bus.  The controller responds
   by placing the IFGTC (Interface Get Command) function on the function bus and
   asserting the ENID (Enable Interface Drivers) and IFVLD (Interface Function
   Valid) signals.  The interface then replies by placing the command on the
   data bus, where it is read by the controller.  The controller then decodes
   the command and initiates processing.

   The controller microprogram runs continuously.  However, command execution
   pauses in various wait loops whenever the controller must suspend until an
   external event occurs.  For example, an Address Record command waits first
   for the CPU to send the cylinder address and then waits again for the CPU to
   send the head/sector address.  The controller then saves these values in
   registers before completing the command and then waiting for the CPU to send
   a new command.

   In simulation, the dl_controller routine is called with a set of flags and
   the content of the data bus whenever the flag state changes or a service
   event occurs.  The routine returns a set of functions and the new content of
   the data bus.  To use the above example, dl_controller would be called with
   CMRDY and the command word and would return IFGTC; the data bus return value
   would not be used in this case.  In hardware, the controller might send a
   series of individual functions to the interface in response to a single
   invocation.  In simulation, this series would be collected into a single
   function set for return.

   Hardware wait loops are simulated by the dl_controller routine returning to
   the caller until the expected external event occurs.  In the Address Record
   example, dl_controller would be called first when the command is issued by
   the CPU.  The routine would initiate command processing and then return to
   wait for the cylinder address.  When the CPU provided the address, the
   interface simulator would call dl_controller again with the cylinder value.
   The routine would then return to wait for the head/sector address.  When it
   was available, dl_controller would be called with the value, and the routine
   would complete the command and return to the caller to wait for a new
   command.  So, in simulation, the controller only "runs" when it has work to
   do.

   A controller instance is represented by a CNTLR_VARS structure, which
   maintains the controller's internal state.  A MAC interface will have a
   single controller instance that controls up to eight drive units, whereas an
   ICD interface will have one controller instance per drive unit.  The minor
   differences in controller action between the two are handled internally.

   The interface simulator must declare one unit for each disc drive to be
   controlled by the library.  For a MAC controller, eight units are required,
   plus one additional unit for the controller itself.  For an ICD controller,
   only one unit is required.

   The controller maintains five values in each drive's unit structure:

     u3 (CYL)    -- the current drive cylinder
     u4 (STATUS) -- the drive status (Status-2)
     u5 (OPCODE) -- the drive current operation in process
     u6 (PHASE)  -- the drive current operation phase
     pos         -- the current byte offset into the disc image file

   Drives maintain their cylinder (head positioner) locations separate from the
   cylinder location stored in the controller.  This allows the controller to
   implement sparing by positioning to one location while storing a different
   location in the sector headers.  It also allows seek retries by issuing a
   Recalibrate (which moves the positioner to cylinder 0) followed by the
   original read or write (which repositioned to the cylinder stored in the
   controller).

   The drive status field contains only a subset of the status maintained by
   drives in hardware.  Specifically, the Attention, Read-Only, First Status,
   and Seek Check bits are stored in the status field.  The other bits (Format
   Enabled, Not Ready, and Drive Busy) are set dynamically whenever status is
   requested (the Drive Fault bit is not simulated).

   Per-drive opcode and phase values allow seeks to be overlapped.  For example,
   a Seek issued to unit 0 may be followed by a Read issued to unit 1.  When the
   seek completes on unit 0, its opcode and phase values will let the controller
   set the appropriate seek completion status without disturbing the values
   currently in-use by unit 1.

   The simulation defines these command phases:

     Idle        -- the unit is not currently executing a command
     Parameter   -- the unit is obtaining or returning parameter values
     Seek        -- the unit is seeking to a new head position
     Rotate      -- the unit is rotating into position to access a sector
     Data        -- the unit is obtaining or returning sector data values
     Intersector -- the unit is rotating between sectors
     End         -- the unit is completing a command

   A value represents the current state of the unit.  If a unit is active, the
   phase will end when the unit is serviced.

   In addition to the controller structure(s), an interface declares a data
   buffer to be used for sector transfers.  The buffer is an array containing
   DL_BUFSIZE 16-bit elements; the address of the buffer is stored in the
   controller state structure.  The controller maintains the current index into
   the buffer, as well as the length of valid data stored there.  Only one
   buffer is needed per interface, regardless of the number of controllers or
   units handled, as a single interface cannot perform data transfers on one
   drive concurrently with a command directed to another drive.

   An interface is also responsible for declaring a structure of type
   DELAY_PROPS that contains the timing values for the controller when in
   FASTTIME mode.  The values are event counts for these actions:

     - track-to-track seek time
     - full-stroke seek time
     - full sector rotation time
     - per-word data transfer time
     - intersector gap time
     - controller execution overhead time

   These values are typically exposed via the interface's register set and so
   may be altered by the user.  A macro, DELAY_INIT, is provided to initialize
   the structure.

   An interface may optionally declare an array of DIAG_ENTRY structures if it
   wishes to use the diagnostic override capability.  Diagnostic overrides are
   used to return controller status values that otherwise are not simulated to a
   diagnostic program.  An example would be a Correctable Data Error or a
   Head-Sector Miscompare.  If this facility is to be used, a pointer to the
   array is placed in the CNTLR_VARS structure when it is initialized, and the
   array itself is initialized with the DL_OVEND value that indicates that no
   overrides are currently defined.

   If the pointer is set, then when each command is started, the cylinder, head,
   sector, and opcode values from the current override entry are checked against
   the corresponding current controller values.  If a match occurs, then the
   controller status and Spare/Protected/Defective values are set from the entry
   rather than being cleared, and the pointer is moved to the next entry.  These
   values will then be returned as the completion status of the current command.

   If the command performs address verification, then any SPD value(s) will be
   used as the result of the verification.  In particular, setting the P bit for
   a Write will cause a Protected Track error if the FORMAT switch is not on,
   and any status value other than Normal Completion, Correctable Data Error, or
   Uncorrectable Data Error will cause a verification abort.

   In hardware, the errors that may occur during verification are Cylinder
   Miscompare, Head-Sector Miscompare, Sync Timeout, Illegal Spare Access, and
   Defective Track; any of these errors may be simulated.  In addition, an
   Uncorrectable Data Error may occur in hardware if the controller is unable to
   verify any of the 16 sectors starting at the sector preceding the target
   sector, but this error cannot be simulated.

   Specifying either a Correctable Data Error or an Uncorrectable Data Error
   will cause an abort at the end of the first sector of a read, write, or
   verify command.

   Correctable Data Error and Uncorrectable Data Error may also be specified for
   the Request Syndrome command.  A table entry with the former status value is
   always followed by an additional entry that contains the values to be
   returned for the three syndrome words and the displacement.

   The last defined table entry always contains a special end-of-table value.

   The controller library provides a macro, DL_MODS, that initializes MTAB
   entries, and two utility routines, dl_set_diag and dl_show_diag, that provide
   a user interface for setting up a table of diagnostic overrides.  See the
   comments for these routines below for the command syntax.

   A macro, CNTLR_INIT, is provided to initialize the controller structure from
   the following parameters:

     - the type of the controller (MAC or ICD)
     - the simulation DEVICE structure on which the controller operates
     - the data buffer array
     - the diagnostic override array or NULL if not used
     - the structure containing the FASTTIME values

   A macro, DL_REGS, is also provided that initializes a set of REG structures
   to provide a user interface to the controller structure.

   In hardware, disc drives respond to commands issued by the controller.  The
   only unsolicited status from drives occurs when the heads are loaded or
   unloaded by the operator.  In simulation, SET <dev> UNLOAD and SET <dev> LOAD
   commands represent these actions.  The controller must be notified by calling
   the dl_load_unload routine in response to changes in a disc drive's RUN/STOP
   switch.

   Finally, the controller library provides extensive tracing of its internal
   operations via debug logging.  Six debug flags are declared for use by the
   interface simulator.  When enabled, these report controller actions at
   various levels of detail.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The library does not simulate sector headers and trailers.  Initialize
       and Write Full Sector commands ignore the SPD bits and the supplied
       header and trailer words.  Read Full Sector fills in the header with the
       current CHS address and sets the SPD bits to zero.  The CRC and ECC words
       in the trailer are returned as zeros.  Programs that depend on drives
       retaining the set values will fail.

    2. The library does not simulate drive hold bits or support multiple CPU
       interfaces connected to the same controller.  CPU access to a valid drive
       always succeeds.

    3. The sector buffer is an array of 16-bit elements.  Byte-oriented
       interface simulators, such as the 12821A HP-IB Disc Interface, must do
       their own byte packing and unpacking.

    4. In hardware, a command pending on an interface (CMRDY asserted) while a
       previous command is executing will be started as soon as the current
       command completes.  In simulation, dl_controller will exit when the
       current command completes and must be called again if CMRDY is asserted.
       This is necessary to allow the completion status of the prior command to
       be returned to the interface before the new command is started.

/* Drive properties table.

   In hardware, drives report their drive type numbers to the controller upon
   receipt of a Request Status tag bus command.  The drive type is used to
   determine the legal range of head and sector addresses (the drive itself will
   validate the cylinder address during a Seek command and the head/sector
   address during an Address Record drive command).

   In simulation, the model ID number from the unit flags is used as an index
   into the drive properties table.  The table is used to validate seek
   parameters and to provide the mapping between CHS addresses and the linear
   byte addresses required by the host file access routines.

   The 7905/06(H) drives consist of removable and fixed platters, whereas the
   7920(H)/25(H) drives have only removable multi-platter packs.  As a result,
   7905/06 drives are almost always accessed in platter mode, i.e., a given
   logical disc area is fully contained on either the removable or fixed
   platter, whereas the 7920/25 drives are almost always accessed in cylinder
   mode with logical disc areas spanning some or all of the platters.

   Disc image files are arranged as a linear set of tracks.  To improve
   locality of access, tracks in the 7905/06 images are grouped per-platter,
   whereas tracks on the 7920 and 7925 are sequential by cylinder and head
   number.

   The simulator maps the tracks on the 7905/06 removable platter (heads 0 and
   1) to the first half of the disc image, and the tracks on the fixed platter
   (heads 2 and, for the 7906 only, 3) to the second half of the image.  For the
   7906(H), the cylinder-head order of the tracks is 0-0, 0-1, 1-0, 1-1, ...,
   410-0, 410-1, 0-2, 0-3, 1-2, 1-3, ..., 410-2, 410-3.  The 7905 order is the
   same, except that head 3 tracks are omitted.

   For the 7920(H)/25(H), all tracks appear in cylinder-head order, e.g., 0-0,
   0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 1-0, 1-1, ..., 822-2, 822-3, 822-4 for the 7920(H).

   This variable-access geometry is accomplished by defining separate "heads per
   cylinder" values for the fixed and removable sections of each drive that
   indicates the number of heads that should be grouped for locality.  The
   removable values are set to 2 on the 7905 and 7906, indicating that those
   drives typically use cylinders consisting of two heads.  They are set to the
   number of heads per drive for the 7920 and 7925, as those typically use
   cylinders encompassing the entire pack.

   The Drive Type is reported by the controller in the second status word
   (Status-2) returned by the Request Status command.

/* Command functions table.

   At each phase of command execution, the controller may return zero or more
   functions for the interface to perform.  The functions control the transfer
   of parameters and data to and from the CPU.  Note that commands do not
   necessarily use all available phases.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Commands usually return BUSY and IFGTC functions to begin.  However, the
       Clear and Set File Mask commands delay the IFGTC function, which requests
       channel service, to the End Phase to ensure that the WRTIO function
       completes before the channel program continues.  This ensures that an End
       I/O order will pick up the correct status value from the interface.

    2. Invalid commands have WRTIO in their Idle_Phase entries because the
       diagnostic expects to see Illegal_Opcode status immediately after the SIO
       program ends.

/* Disc library global controller routines */


/* Disc controller interface.

   This routine simulates the hardware interconnection between the disc
   controller and the CPU interface.  This routine is called whenever the flag
   state changes.  This would be when a new command is to be started, when
   command parameters are supplied or status words are retrieved, and when
   sector data is read or written.  It must also be called when the unit service
   routine is entered.  The caller passes in the set of interface flags and the
   contents of the data buffer.  The routine returns a set of functions and, if
   IFIN is included in set, the new content of the data buffer.

   In hardware, the controller microcode executes in one of three states:

    1. In the Poll Loop, which looks for commands and drive attention requests.

       In each pass of the loop, the next CPU interface in turn is selected and
       checked for a command; if present, it is executed.  If not, the
       interface is disconnected, and then all drives are checked in turn until
       one is found with Attention status; if none are found, the loop
       continues.  If a drive is requesting attention, the associated CPU
       interface is selected to check for a command; if present, it is executed.
       If not, and the interface allows interrupts, an interrupt request is made
       and the Command Wait Loop is entered.  If interrupts are not allowed, the
       interface is disconnected, and the Poll Loop continues.

    2. In the Command Wait Loop, which looks for commands.

       In each pass of the loop, the currently selected CPU interface is checked
       for a command; if present, it is executed.  If not, the Command Wait Loop
       continues.  While in the loop, a 1.74 second timer is running.  If it
       expires before a command is received, the file mask is reset, the current
       interface is disconnected, and the Poll Loop is entered.

    3. In command execution, which processes the current command.

       While a command is executing, any waits for input parameters, seek
       completion, data transfers, or output status words are handled
       internally.  Each wait is governed by the 1.74 second timer; if it
       expires, the command is aborted, the file mask is reset, the current
       interface is disconnected, and the Poll Loop is reentered.

   In simulation, these states are represented by the CNTLR_STATE values
   Idle_State, Wait_State, and Busy_State, respectively.

   A MAC controller operates from one to eight drives, represented by an array
   of one to eight UNITs.  The unit number present in the command is used to
   index to the target unit via the "units" pointer in the DEVICE structure.
   One additional unit that represents the controller is required, separate from
   the individual drive units.  Commands that do not access the drive, such as
   Address Record, are scheduled on the controller unit to allow controller
   commands to execute while drive units are seeking.  The command wait timer is
   also scheduled on the controller unit to limit the amount of time the
   controller will wait for the interface to supply a command or parameter.

   An ICD simulation manages a single unit corresponding to the drive in which
   the controller is integrated.  A device interface declares a UNIT array
   corresponding to the number of drives supported and passes the unit number to
   use during controller initialization.  A controller unit is not used, as all
   commands are scheduled on the drive unit associated with a given controller.

   On entry, the flags and controller state are examined to determine if a new
   controller command should be initiated or the current command should be
   continued.  If this routine is being called as a result of an event service,
   "uptr" will point at the unit being serviced.  Otherwise, "uptr" will be NULL
   (for example, when starting a new controller command).

   If the CLEARF flag is asserted, then perform a hard clear on the controller.
   Otherwise, if a 3000 channel error has occurred, then terminate any command
   in progress and return I/O Program Error status.  Otherwise, if the
   controller is currently busy with a command, or if this is an event service
   entry, then process the next step of the command.  Otherwise, if the CMRDY
   flag is asserted, then start a new command.  If none of these cases pertain,
   or if the controller is now idle, poll the drives for attention.

   In all cases, return a combined function set and outbound data word to the
   caller.


   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine will be entered when the drive unit event service occurs
       for seek completion, and Seek_Phase processing in continue_command will
       set the drive's Attention bit.  The drives must then be polled and the
       return functions and TIO value set to generate a CPU interrupt.

       A seek command started on one drive while a second drive already has its
       Attention bit set would seem to overwrite the first drive's Seek
       completion status with the second drive's Attention status.  However,
       this won't occur because INTOK will not be set until the first drive's
       channel program completes, and so the drive poll is inhibited until then.

/* Start a new command.

   This routine simulates the controller microcode entry into the command
   executor corresponding to the command presented by the CPU interface.  It's
   called when the controller is waiting for a command and the interface asserts
   CMRDY to indicate that a new command is available.  It returns a set of
   action functions and a data word to the caller.  For a good command, it also
   sets up the next phase of operation on the controller and/or drive unit and
   schedules the unit(s) as appropriate.

   On entry, the command word is supplied in the "inbound_data" parameter; this
   simulates the microcode issuing an IFPRF (Interface Prefetch) to obtain the
   command.  The opcode is isolated from the command word and checked for
   validity.  If it's OK, it's used as an index into the command properties
   table.  If the command contains a unit number field, it is extracted, checked
   for validity, and used to derive a pointer to the corresponding UNIT
   structure.  If the command does not access the drive, or if the unit number
   is invalid, the unit pointer is set to NULL.  A pointer to the controller
   unit is also set up; for ICD controllers, the controller and drive unit are
   the same.

   The controller library supports up to eight drives per MAC controller and one
   drive per ICD controller.  Unit numbers 0-7 represent valid drive addresses
   for a MAC controller.  The unit number field is ignored for an ICD
   controller, and unit 0 is always implied.  In simulation, MAC unit numbers
   correspond one-for-one with device units, whereas one ICD controller is
   associated with each of the several device units that are independently
   addressed as unit 0.

   The MAC controller firmware allows access to unit numbers 8-10 without
   causing a Unit Unavailable error.  Instead, the controller reports these
   legal-but-invalid units as permanently offline.

   If a diagnostic override is defined, and the cylinder, head, sector, and
   opcode values from the current override entry match their corresponding
   controller values, then the status and SPD values are set from the entry
   rather than being cleared, and the pointer is moved to the next entry.  The
   controller is then set to the busy state, and the validity of the opcode and
   unit are checked.  If any errors are detected, the appropriate status is set,
   and the controller unit is scheduled for the End_Phase to simulate the
   controller processing overhead.

   If the command and unit are valid, then if the command accesses a drive unit,
   the unit's OPCODE field is set, and any pending Attention status is cleared.
   If the command takes or returns parameters, then the Parameter_Phase is set
   up on the controller unit and the wait timer is started.  Commands that
   return parameters temporarily store their parameter values in the sector
   buffer at this time for return as the CPU interface requests them.  The Cold
   Load Read and Recalibrate commands start their respective seeks at this time,
   and commands that complete immediately, e.g., Set File Mask, Wakeup, etc.,
   schedule the End_Phase on the controller unit and set up the status value for
   return if they end with the WRTIO function.

   Finally, the controller and/or drive units are activated if they were
   scheduled.  If a seek is in progress on a drive when a command that
   waits for seek completion is started, the unit is not rescheduled.  Instead,
   the unit is left in the Seek_Phase, but the unit's OPCODE field is changed to
   reflect the new command so that the command will start automatically when the
   seek completes.


   Implementation notes:

    1. A command is started only if the controller is not busy.  Therefore, the
       target unit can be only in either the Seek_Phase or the Idle_Phase, as
       all other phases will have the controller in the Busy_State.

    2. Commands that access units and take parameters (e.g., Verify) set up the
       parameter access on the controller unit but perform the rest of the
       operation on the drive unit.  The controller must be used so that
       parameters may be read for the next command for a unit that is currently
       seeking (stacked commands wait for seek completion after parameters have
       been read).

    3. Drive Attention may be still set on a drive that has completed a seek but
       has not been able to interrupt the CPU before a new command is started.
       Therefore, Attention is always cleared when a command starts.

    4. In hardware, the Recalibrate command waits for a seek-in-progress to
       complete before the RCL tag is sent to the drive.  In simulation,
       repositioning the heads to cylinder 0 is started immediately, but any
       remaining time from a seek-in-progress is added to the time required for
       repositioning.  The effect is that recalibration completes in the time it
       would have taken for the seek-in-progress to complete followed by
       repositioning from that location.

    5. The Cold Load Read command does not check for Access Not Ready before
       issuing the seek to cylinder 0, so if a seek or recalibrate is in
       progress, the drive will reject it with a Seek Check error.  However, the
       command continues, and when the seek in progress completes and the read
       begins, the Seek Check error will abort the command at this point with a
       Status-2 Error.

    6. ECC is not simulated, so the Request Syndrome command always returns zero
       values for the displacement and patterns and Uncorrectable Data Error for
       the status, unless a diagnostic override is in effect.

    7. The Wakeup command references a drive unit but is scheduled on the
       controller unit because it may be issued while the drive is seeking.

/* Continue the current command.

   This routine simulates continuing execution of the controller microcode for
   the current command.  It's called whenever the controller has had to wait for
   action from the CPU interface or the drive unit, and that action has now
   occurred.  Typically, this would be whenever the interface flag status
   changes, or a unit's event service has been entered.  It returns a set of
   action functions and a data word to the caller.  It also sets up the next
   phase of operation on the controller and/or drive unit and schedules the
   unit(s) as appropriate.

   On entry, the "uptr" parameter is set to NULL if the controller was called
   for a CPU interface action, or it points to the unit whose event service was
   just called; this may be either the controller unit or a drive unit.  The
   "inbound_flags" and "inbound_data" parameters contain the CPU interface flags
   and data buffer values.

   If the entry is for a unit service, the unit number of the drive requesting
   service is determined.  If the entry is for the CPU interface, the controller
   is checked; if it's idle, the routine returns because no command is in
   progress.

   While a unit is activated, the current phase indicates the reason for the
   activation, i.e., what the simulated drive is "doing" at the moment, as
   follows:

     Idle_Phase        -- waiting for the next command to be issued (note that
                          this phase, which indicates that the unit is not
                          scheduled, is distinct from the controller Idle_State,
                          which indicates that the controller itself is idle)

     Parameter_Phase   -- waiting for a parameter to be transferred to or from
                          the interface

     Seek_Phase        -- waiting for a seek to complete (explicit or automatic)

     Rotate_Phase      -- waiting for the target sector to arrive under the head

     Data_Phase        -- waiting for the interface to accept or return the next
                          data word to be transferred to or from the drive

     Intersector_Phase -- waiting for the controller to finish executing the
                          end-of-sector microcode

     End_Phase         -- waiting for the controller to finish executing the
                          microcode corresponding to the current command

   Depending on the current command opcode and phase, a number of actions may be
   taken:

     Idle_Phase -- If the controller unit is being serviced, then the 1.74
     second command wait timer has expired while waiting for a new command.
     Reset the file mask and idle the controller.

     Parameter_Phase -- If the controller unit is being serviced, then the 1.74
     second command wait timer has expired while waiting for a parameter from
     the CPU.  Reset the file mask and idle the controller.  Otherwise, for
     outbound parameters, return the next word from the sector buffer and
     restart the timer; if the last word has been sent, end the command.  For
     inbound parameters, store the next word in the appropriate controller state
     variable; if the last word has been received, end the command or set up the
     next operation phase (seek, rotate, etc.).

     Seek_Phase -- If a Seek or Recalibrate has completed, set Drive Attention
     status.  All other commands have been waiting for seek completion before
     starting, so set up the rotate phase to begin the command.

     Rotate_Phase -- Set up the read or write of the current sector.  For all
     commands except Verify, proceed to the data phase to begin the data
     transfer.  For Verify, skip the data phase and proceed directly to the
     end-of-sector processing, but schedule that event as though the full sector
     rotation time had elapsed.

     Data_Phase -- For read transfers, return the next word from the sector
     buffer, or for write transfers, store the next word into the sector buffer,
     and schedule the next data phase transfer if the CPU has not indicated an
     end-of-data condition.  If it has, or if the last word of the sector has
     been transmitted, schedule the intersector phase.

     Intersector_Phase -- Complete the read or write of the current sector.  If
     the CPU has indicated an end-of-data condition, end the command.
     Otherwise, address the next sector and schedule the rotate phase.

     End_Phase -- End the command.  The end phase is used to provide a
     controller delay when an operation has no other command phases.

   At the completion of the current phase, the next phase is scheduled, if
   required, before returning the appropriate function set and data word to the
   caller.

   The commands employ the various phases as follows:
                                                               Inter
       Command                  Param   Seek   Rotate   Data   sector   End

     Key:
       C = controller unit is scheduled
       c = controller is called directly by the CPU interface
       D = drive unit is scheduled
       - = the phase is not used


   Implementation notes:

    1. The "%.0d" print specification in the trace call absorbs the zero "unit"
       value parameter without printing when the controller unit is specified.

    2. The Seek command does not check for Access Not Ready before issuing the
       seek, so if a prior seek is in progress, the drive will reject it with a
       Seek Check error.  However, the parameters (e.g., controller CHS
       addresses) are still set as though the command had succeeded.

       A Seek command will return to the Poll Loop with Seek Check status set.
       When the seek in progress completes, the controller will interrupt with
       Drive Attention status.  The controller address will differ from the
       drive address, so it's incumbent upon the caller to issue a Request
       Status command after the seek, which will return Status-2 Error status.

    3. The set of interface functions to assert on command completion is
       normally specified by the End_Phase entry in the cmd_functions table,
       regardless of whether or not a command has an end phase.  However, the
       Request Syndrome command returns either Correctable Data Error or
       Uncorrectable Data Error for normal command completion.  These status
       returns would normally include DVEND to indicate that the command should
       be retried, but that's wrong for Request Syndrome, so we explicitly
       override the function set for this command.

    4. Command completion must be detected by the controller state changing to
       "not busy" rather than simply being "not busy" at the end of the routine.
       Otherwise, a seek that completes while the controller is waiting for a
       command would re-issue the end phase functions.

    5. The disc is a synchronous device, so overrun or underrun can occur if the
       interface is not ready when the controller must transfer data.  There are
       four conditions that lead to an overrun or underrun:

         a. The controller is ready with a disc read word (IFCLK * IFIN), but
            the interface buffer is full (DTRDY).

         b. The controller needs a disc write word (IFCLK * IFOUT), but the
            interface buffer is empty (~DTRDY).

         c. The CPU attempts to read a word, but the interface buffer is empty
            (~DTRDY).

         d. The CPU attempts to write a word, but the interface buffer is full
            (DTRDY).

       The 13037 controller ORs the interface-supplied OVRUN signal with an
       internal overrun latch that sets on condition 2 above (write underrun).
       However, both the 13175A HP 1000 interface and the 30229B HP 3000
       interface assert OVRUN for all four conditions, so the latch is not
       simulated.

    6. Not all changes of CPU interface flag status are significant.  If the
       routine is called when it isn't needed, the routine simply returns with
       no action.

/* Poll the drives for Attention status.

   MAC controllers complete their Seek and Recalibrate commands when the seeks
   are initiated, so that other drives may be serviced during the waits.  A
   drive will set its Attention status when its seek completes, and the
   controller must poll the drives for attention requests when it is idle and
   interrupts are allowed by the CPU interface.

   Starting with the last unit that had previously requested attention, each
   drive is checked in sequence.  If a drive has its Attention status set, the
   controller saves its unit number, sets the result status to Drive Attention,
   and enters the command wait state.  The routine returns a function set that
   indicates that an interrupt should be generated.  The next time the routine
   is called, the poll begins with the last unit that requested attention, so
   that each unit is given an equal chance to respond.

   If no unit is requesting attention, the routine returns an empty function set
   to indicate that no interrupt should be generated.

   ICD controllers do not call this routine, because each controller waits for
   seek completion on its dedicated drive before completing the associated Seek
   or Recalibrate command.

   PRESET jumper is installed in the enabled position (which is the usual case).
   The 30229B interface for the HP 3000 asserts CLEAR in response to an IORESET
   signal or a programmed Master Reset if the PRESET DISABLE jumper is installed
   in the enabled position.

   The third condition, a "timeout clear", also causes a firmware restart but
   with the PWRON flag clear.  The last condition, a "soft clear" is executed in
   the command handler and therefore returns to the Command Wait Loop instead of
   the Poll Loop.

   For a hard clear, the 13037 controller will:

     - disconnect the CPU interface
     - zero the controller RAM (no drives held, last polled unit number reset)
     - clear the clock offset
     - clear the file mask
     - issue a Controller Preset to clear all connected drives
     - enter the Poll Loop (which clears the controller status)

   For a timeout clear, the 13037 controller will:

     - disconnect the CPU interface
     - clear the hold bits of any drives held by the interface that timed out
     - clear the clock offset
     - clear the file mask
     - enter the Poll Loop (which clears the controller status)

   For a programmed "soft" clear, the 13037 controller will:

     - clear the controller status
     - issue a Controller Preset to clear all connected drives
     - enter the Command Wait Loop

   Controller Preset is a tag bus command that is sent to all drives connected
   to the controller.  Each drive will:

     - disconnect from the controller
     - clear its internal drive faults
     - clear its head and sector registers
     - clear its illegal head and sector flip-flops
     - reset its seek check, first status, drive fault, and attention status

   On a 7905 or 7906 drive, clearing the head register will change Read-Only
   status to reflect the position of the PROTECT LOWER DISC switch.

   In simulation, a hard clear occurs when an SCP RESET command is entered, or a
   programmed CLC 0 instruction or Master Clear is executed.  A timeout clear
   occurs when the command or parameter wait timer expires.  A soft clear occurs
   when a programmed Clear command is issued.

   Because the controller execution state is implemented by scheduling command
   phases for the target or controller unit, a simulated firmware restart must
   abort any in-process activation.  However, a firmware restart does not affect
   seeks in progress, so these must be allowed to continue to completion so that
   their Attention requests will be honored.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The specific 13365 controller actions on hard or soft clears are not
       documented.  Therefore, an ICD controller clear is handled as a MAC
       controller clear, except that only the current drive is preset (as an ICD
       controller manages only a single drive).

    2. Neither hard nor soft clears affect the controller flags (e.g., EOC) or
       registers (e.g., cylinder address).

    3. In simulation, an internal seek, such as an auto-seek during a Read
       command or the initial seek during a Cold Load Read command, will be
       aborted for a hard clear, whereas in hardware it would complete normally.
       This is OK, however, because an internal seek always clears the drive's
       Attention status on completion, so aborting the simulated seek is
       equivalent to an immediate seek completion.

    4. If a drive unit is disabled, it is still cleared.  A unit cannot be
       disabled while it is active, so it must be in the idle state while
       disabled.  Clearing the status keeps it consistent in case it is
       reenabled later.

    5. A soft clear does not abort commands in progress on a drive unit.
       However, a soft clear is a result of a programmed command that can only
       be issued when the prior command has completed (except for Seek and
       Recalibrate commands, which are never aborted).

    6. In simulation, a Controller Preset only resets the specified status bits,
       as the remainder of the hardware actions are not implemented.

/* Load or unload the drive heads.

   In hardware, a drive's heads are loaded when a disc pack is installed and the
   RUN/STOP switch is set to RUN.  The drive reports First Status when the heads
   load to indicate that the pack has potentially changed.  Setting the switch
   to STOP unloads the heads.  When the heads are unloaded, the drive reports
   Not Ready and Drive Busy status.  In both cases, the drive reports Attention
   status to the controller.  A MAC controller will clear a drive's Attention
   status and will interrupt the CPU when the drives are polled in the Idle
   Loop.  An ICD controller also clears the drive's Attention status but will
   assert a Parallel Poll Response only when the heads unload.

   In simulation, the unit must be attached, corresponding to having a disc pack
   installed in the drive, before the heads may be unloaded or loaded.  If it
   isn't, the routine returns SCPE_UNATT.  Otherwise, the UNIT_UNLOAD flag and
   the drive status are set accordingly.

   If the (MAC) controller is idle, the routine returns SCPE_INCOMP to indicate
   that the caller must then call the controller to poll for drive attention to
   complete the command.  Otherwise, it returns SCPE_OK, and the drives will be
   polled automatically when the current command or command wait completes and
   the controller is idled.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Loading or unloading the heads clears Fault and Seek Check status.

    2. If we are called during a RESTORE command, the unit's flags are not
       changed to avoid upsetting the state that was SAVEd.

    3. Unloading an active unit does not cancel the event.  This ensures that
       the controller will not hang during a transfer but instead will see the
       unloaded unit and fail the transfer with Access_Not_Ready status.

   This validation routine is called to set the write protection status of the

   indicates whether the drive is to be protected (1) or unprotected (0).

   In hardware, the 7920 and 7925 drives have a READ ONLY switch that write-
   protects all heads in the drive, and Read-Only status directly reflects the
   position of the switch.  The switch is simulated by the SET <unit> PROTECT
   and SET <unit> UNPROTECT commands.

   The 7905 and 7906 drives have separate PROTECT UPPER DISC and PROTECT LOWER
   DISC switches that protect heads 0-1 and 2 (7905) or 2-3 (7906),
   respectively, and Read-Only status reflects the position of the switch
   associated with the head currently addressed by the drive's Head Register.
   The Head Register is loaded by the controller as part of a Seek or Cold Load
   Read command, or during an auto-seek or spare track seek, if permitted by the
   file mask.  A Controller Preset command sent to a drive clears the Head
   Register, so Read-Only status reflects the PROTECT UPPER DISC switch setting.

   The SET <unit> PROTECT=(UPPER | LOWER) and SET <unit> UNPROTECT=(UPPER |
   LOWER) simulation commands are provided to protect or unprotect the upper or
   lower heads individually.  If the option values are omitted, e.g., SET <unit>
   PROTECT, then both upper and lower heads are (un)protected.

/* Set or clear the diagnostic override table.

   This validation routine is called to set or clear the diagnostic override
   table associated with the specified unit.  The "value" parameter is either
   the positive maximum table entry count if an entry is to be added, or zero if
   the table is to be cleared, and "desc" is a pointer to the controller.

   If the CPU interface declares a diagnostic override table, it will specify
   the table when initializing the controller variables structure with the
   CNTLR_INIT macro.  This sets the "dop_base" pointer in the structure to point
   at the table.  If the interface does not declare a table, the pointer will be
   NULL.

   If the table is present, new entries may be added with this command:

     SET <dev> DIAG=<cylinder>;<head>;<sector>;<opcode>;<spd>;<status>

   The cylinder, head, and sector values are entered as decimal numbers, the
   opcode and status values are entered as octal numbers, and the SPD value is
   specified as any combination of the letters "S", "P", or "D".

   If a command specifies the opcode value as Request Syndrome (15) and the
   status value as Correctable Data Error (17), then four additional values must
   be specified as part of the command line above:

      ;<displacement>;<syndrome 1>;<syndrome 2>;<syndrome 3>

   The displacement value is entered as a decimal number, and the three syndrome
   values are entered as octal numbers.

   Entering SET <dev> DIAG by itself resets the current entry pointer to the
   first table entry.  Entering SET <dev> NODIAG clears the table.

   If the override table was not declared by the CPU interface, the routine
   returns "Command not allowed."  If SET NODIAG was entered, the "value"
   parameter will be -1, and the table will be cleared by storing the special
   value DL_OVEND into the first table entry.  Otherwise, if SET DIAG is
   entered, the table pointer is reset.  However, if the table is already empty,
   the routine returns "Missing value" to indicate that the table must be
   populated first.

   If a new entry is to be added, the "value" parameter will indicate the size
   of the table in entries.  If no free entry exists, the routine returns
   "Memory exhausted".  Otherwise, the supplied parameters are parsed and
   entered into the table.  An array of maximum allowed values and radixes are
   used during parsing to validate each parameter.  The non-numeric SPD
   parameter is parsed separately.  If, after parsing the first six parameters,
   the opcode and status are Request Syndrome and Correctable Data Error,
   respectively, then four more parameters are sought.  These are stored into
   the following table entry.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Each maximum array element value limits the absolute value of its
       corresponding numeric parameter.  Negative values may be specified for
       unsigned values; no error is returned, and these simply will never match
       their intended controller values.

    2. Each radix array element value is used to parse its corresponding
       parameter.  A radix of 0 is used to indicate the S/P/D parameter, which
       is parsed alphabetically rather than numerically.

    3. One table entry is always reserved for the end-of-table value, so the
       number of configurable entries is one less than the defined table size.

/* Show the diagnostic override table.

   This display routine is called to show the contents of the diagnostic
   override table.  The "value" parameter is either the positive maximum table
   entry count if the routine was invoked by a SHOW <dev> DIAG command, or -1 if
   the routine was invoked by a SHOW <dev> command.  The "desc" parameter is a
   pointer to the controller.

   If the override table was not declared by the CPU interface, the routine
   returns "Command not allowed."  Otherwise, if the table is empty, the routine
   prints "override disabled".  If the table is populated, then the routine
   prints "override enabled" if it was invoked as part of a general SHOW for the
   device, or it prints the individual table entries if it was invoked as SHOW
   <dev> DIAG.

   Entries are printed in tabular form with the columns corresponding to the SET
   DIAG parameters, except that the opcode and status fields are decoded.  A
   Request Syndrome command entry with Correctable Data Error status is followed
   by an indented second line containing the displacement and syndrome values.
   Numeric values are printed in the same radix as is used to enter them.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The Request Syndrome displacement parameter is a 16-bit signed value
       contained in a 32-bit unsigned array element.  To print it properly, we
       convert the latter to a 16-bit signed value and then sign-extend to "int"
       size for fprintf.

    2. The explicit use of "const CNTLR_VARS *" is necessary to declare a
       pointer to a constant structure.  Using "const CVPTR" declares a constant
       pointer instead.

/* Set the controller timing mode.

   This validation routine is called to set the timing mode for the disc
   subsystem.  As this is an extended MTAB call, the "uptr" parameter points to
   the unit array of the device.  The "value" parameter is set to 1 to use
   realistic timing and 0 to use fast timing.  For a MAC controller, the "desc"
   parameter is a pointer to the controller.  For ICD controllers, the "desc"
   parameter is a pointer to the first element of the controller array.  There
   must be one controller for each unit defined by the device associated with
   the controllers.

   If fast timing is selected, the controller's timing pointer is set to the
   fast timing pointer supplied by the interface when the controller was
   initialized.  If real timing is selected, the table of real times is searched
   for an entry whose controller type matches the supplied controller.  MAC and
   ICD controllers support several drive models with identical timing
   characteristics.  However, CS/80 controllers allow mixing drives with
   different timing on a single CPU interface.  For these, the drive type must
   match as well.  If a match is found, the controller's timing pointer is set
   to the associated real-time entry.  Otherwise, the routine returns SCPE_IERR.

   Non-MAC controllers are dedicated per-drive, so "desc" points not at a single
   controller instance but at an array of controller instances.  The timing mode
   is common to every controller in the array.

/* Start a read operation on the current sector.

   This routine is called at the end of the rotate phase to begin a read
   operation.  The current sector given by the controller address is read from
   the disc image file into the sector buffer in preparation for data transfer
   to the CPU.  If the end of the track had been reached, and the file mask
   permits, an auto-seek is scheduled instead to allow the read to continue.
   The routine returns TRUE if the data is ready to be transferred and FALSE if
   it is not (due to command completion, an error, or an auto-seek that must
   complete first).

   On entry, the end-of-data flag is checked.  If it is set, the current read
   command is completed.  Otherwise, the buffer data offset and verify options
   are set up.  For a Read Full Sector, the sync word is set from the controller
   type, and dummy cylinder and head-sector words are generated from the current
   location (as would be the case in the absence of track sparing).

   The image file is positioned to the correct sector in preparation for
   reading.  If the positioning requires a permitted seek, it is scheduled, and
   the routine returns with the Seek_Phase set to wait for seek completion
   before resuming the read (when the seek completes, the service routine will
   be entered, and we will be called again; this time, the end-of-cylinder flag
   will be clear and positioning will succeed).  If positioning resulted in an
   error, the current read is terminated with the error status set.

   If positioning succeeded within the same track, the sector image is read into
   the buffer at an offset determined by the operation (Read Full Sector leaves
   room at the start of the buffer for the sector header).  If the image read
   failed with a host file system error, it is reported to the simulation
   console and the read ends with an Uncorrectable Data Error.  If it succeeded
   but did not return a full sector, the remainder of the buffer is padded with
   zeros.

   If the image was read correctly, the operation phase is set for the data
   transfer, the index of the first word to transfer is set, and the routine
   returns TRUE to begin the data transfer.


   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine changes the unit phase state as follows:

         Rotate_Phase => Idle_Phase if EOD or error (returns FALSE)
         Rotate_Phase => Seek_Phase if auto-seek (returns FALSE)
         Rotate_Phase => Data_Phase otherwise (returns TRUE)

    2. The position_sector routine sets up the data phase if it succeeds or the
       seek phase if a seek is required.

   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine changes the unit phase state as follows:

         Intersector_Phase => Idle_Phase if EOD or error
         Intersector_Phase => Rotate_Phase otherwise

    2. The HP 1000 CPU indicates the end of a read data transfer to an ICD
       controller by untalking the drive.  The untalk is done by the driver as
       soon as the DCPC completion interrupt is processed.  However, the time
       from the final DCPC transfer through driver entry to the point where the
       untalk is asserted on the bus varies from 80 instructions (RTE-6/VM with
       OS microcode and the buffer in the system map) to 152 instructions
       (RTE-IVB with the buffer in the user map).  The untalk must occur before
       the start of the next sector, or the drive will begin the data transfer.

       Normally, this is not a problem, as the driver clears the FIFO of any
       received data after DCPC completion.  However, if the read terminates
       after the last sector of a track, and accessing the next sector would
       require an intervening seek, and the file mask disables auto-seeking or
       an enabled seek would move the positioner beyond the drive limits, then
       the controller will indicate an End of Cylinder error if the untalk does
       not arrive before the seek is initiated.

       The RTE driver (DVA32) and various utilities that manage the disc
       directly (e.g., SWTCH) do not appear to account for these bogus errors,
       so the ICD controller hardware must avoid them in some unknown manner.
       We work around the issue by extending the intersector delay to allow time
       for a potential untalk whenever the next access would otherwise fail.

       Note that this issue does not occur with writes because DCPC completion
       asserts EOI concurrently with the final data byte to terminate the
       command explicitly.

       Note also that the delay is a fixed number of instructions, regardless of
       timing mode, to ensure that the CPU makes it through the driver code to
       output the untalk command.

/* Start a write operation on the current sector.

   This routine is called at the end of the rotate phase to begin a write
   operation.  The current sector indicated by the controller address is
   positioned for writing from the sector buffer to the disc image file after
   data transfer from the CPU.  If the end of the track had been reached, and
   the file mask permits, an auto-seek is scheduled instead to allow the write
   to continue.   The routine returns TRUE if the data is ready to be
   transferred and FALSE if it is not (due to an error or an auto-seek that must
   complete first).

   On entry, if writing is not permitted, or formatting is required but not
   enabled, the command is terminated with an error.  Otherwise, the disc image
   file is positioned to the correct sector in preparation for writing.

   If the positioning requires a permitted seek, it is scheduled, and the
   routine returns with the Seek_Phase set to wait for seek completion before
   resuming the write (when the seek completes, the service routine will be
   entered, and we will be called again; this time, the end-of-cylinder flag
   will be clear and positioning will succeed).  If positioning resulted in an
   error, the current write is terminated with the error status set.

   If positioning succeeded within the same track, the operation phase is set
   for the data transfer, the index of the first word to transfer is set, and
   the routine returns TRUE to begin the data transfer.


   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine changes the unit phase state as follows:

         Rotate_Phase => Idle_Phase if write protected or error (returns FALSE)
         Rotate_Phase => Seek_Phase if auto-seek (returns FALSE)
         Rotate_Phase => Data_Phase otherwise (returns TRUE)

    2. The position_sector routine sets up the data phase if it succeeds or the
       seek phase if a seek is required.

/* Finish a write operation on the current sector.

   This routine is called at the end of the intersector phase to finish a write

   image file at the current file position.  The next sector address is then
   updated to allow writing to continue.

   On entry, the drive is checked to ensure that it is ready for the write.
   Then the sector buffer is padded appropriately if a full sector of data was
   not transferred.  The buffer is written to the disc image file at the
   position corresponding to the controller address as set when the sector was
   started.  The write begins at a buffer offset determined by the command (a
   Write Full Sector has three header words at the start of the buffer that are
   not written to the disc image).

   If the image write failed with a host file system error, it is reported to
   the simulation console and the write ends with an Uncorrectable Data Error.
   If it succeeded, the diagnostic override status is checked.  If it is set,
   then the write is terminated with the indicated status.  Otherwise, the data
   overrun flag is checked.  If it is set, the write is terminated with an
   error.  Otherwise, the next sector is addressed.  If the end-of-data flag is
   set, the current write is completed.  Otherwise,the rotate phase is set up in
   preparation for the next sector write.

/* Position the disc image file at the current sector.

   The image file is positioned at the byte address corresponding to the drive's
   current cylinder and the controller's current head and sector addresses.
   Positioning may involve an auto-seek if a prior read or write addressed the
   final sector of a cylinder.  If a seek is initiated or an error is detected,
   the routine returns FALSE to indicate that the positioning was not performed.
   If the file was positioned, the routine returns TRUE.

   On entry, the diagnostic override status is checked.  If it is set to
   anything other than a data error, then positioning is terminated with the
   indicated status to simulate an address verification failure.  Otherwise, if
   the controller's end-of-cylinder flag is set, a prior read or write addressed
   the final sector in the current cylinder.  If the file mask does not permit
   auto-seeking, the command is terminated with an End of Cylinder error.
   Otherwise, the cylinder is incremented or decremented as directed by the file
   mask, and a seek to the new cylinder is started.

   If the increment or decrement resulted in an out-of-bounds value, the seek
   will return Seek Check status, and the command is terminated with an error.
   Otherwise, the seek is legal, and the routine returns with the seek phase set
   to wait for seek completion before resuming the current read or write.  When
   the seek completes, the service routine will be entered, and we will be
   called again; this time, the end-of-cylinder flag will be clear and the read
   or write will continue on the new cylinder.

   If the EOC flag was not set, the drive's position is checked against the
   controller's position if address verification is requested.  If they are
   different, as may occur with an Address Record command that specified a
   different location than the last Seek command, a seek is started to the
   correct cylinder, and the routine returns with the unit set to the seek phase
   to wait for seek completion as above.

   If the drive and controller positions agree or address verification is not
   requested, the CHS addresses are validated against the drive limits.  If they
   are invalid, Seek Check status is set, and the command is terminated with an
   error.

   If the addresses are valid, the drive is checked to ensure that it is ready
   for positioning.  If it is, the file is positioned to a byte offset in the
   image file that is calculated from the CHS address.  The data phase is set up
   to begin the data transfer, and the routine returns TRUE to indicate that the
   file position is set.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The ICD controller returns an End of Cylinder error if an auto-seek
       results in a position beyond the drive limits.  The MAC controller
       returns a Status-2 error.  Both controllers set the Seek Check bit in the
       drive status word.

   This routine is called after a sector has been successfully read or written
   in preparation for continuing the transfer.  It is also called after the
   Request Syndrome command returns the correction status for a sector in error.

   The controller's CHS address is incremented to point at the next sector.  If
   the next sector number is valid, the routine returns.  Otherwise, the sector
   number is reset to sector 0 and the address verification state is reset to
   enable it for a Read_Without_Verify command.  If the file mask is set for
   cylinder mode, the head is incremented, and if the new head number is valid,
   the routine returns.  If the head number is invalid, it is reset to head 0,
   and the end-of-cylinder flag is set.  The EOC flag is also set if the file
   mask is set for surface mode.

   The new cylinder address is not set here, because cylinder validation must
   only occur when the next sector is actually accessed.  Otherwise, reading or
   writing the last sector on a track or cylinder with auto-seek disabled would
   cause an End of Cylinder error, even if the transfer ended with that sector.
   Instead, we set the EOC flag to indicate that a cylinder update is pending.

   As a result of this deferred update method, the state of the EOC flag must be
   considered when returning the disc address to the CPU.

/* Start a seek.

   A seek is initiated on the indicated unit if the drive is ready and the
   cylinder, head, and sector values in the controller are valid for the current
   drive model.  The routine returns TRUE if the unit is seeking and FALSE if
   the seek failed to start.

   If the drive is not ready, the seek fails immediately with a Status-2 error.
   If the drive is already seeking, Seek Check status will occur, and the
   routine will return TRUE to allow the current seek to complete normally.

   Otherwise, a seek is initiated to cylinder 0 if the current command is
   Recalibrate or to the cylinder value stored in the controller if it is not.
   EOC is reset for a seek but not for recalibrate, so that a reseek will return
   to the same location as was current when the recalibration was done.

   If the controller cylinder is beyond the drive's limit, Seek Check status is
   set in the unit, and the heads are not moved.  Otherwise, the relative
   cylinder position change is calculated, and the heads are moved to the new
   position.

   If the controller head or sector is beyond the drive's limit, Seek Check
   status is set in the unit.  Otherwise, Seek Check status is cleared.

   In hardware, the controller issues tag bus SEEK and ADR (address record)
   commands to the drive to load the drive's cylinder, head, and sector
   registers.  On the 7905 and 7906 drives, loading the head register
   establishes the drive's Read-Only status in conjunction with the PROTECT
   UPPER/LOWER DISC switch settings.

   A seek check for either the cylinder, head, or sector terminates the current
   command for an ICD controller.  For a MAC controller, the seek check is noted
   in the drive status, but processing will continue until the drive sets
   Attention status.

   Finally, the unit is set to the seek phase, and the scheduling delay is
   calculated by the distance the heads traversed (in real time mode), or
   it is set to a fixed delay (in fast time mode).


   Implementation notes:

    1. For ICD drives, a seek check will terminate the command immediately with
       a Status-2 error.  A seek-in-progress seek check cannot occur on an ICD
       drive, however, because the second seek command will not be started until
       the first seek completes.

    2. In hardware, a seek to the current location will set Drive Busy status
       for 1.3 milliseconds (the head settling time).  In simulation, disc
       service is scheduled as though a one-cylinder seek was requested.

    3. The head register contents does not affect Read-Only status on the 7920
       or 7925, which is established solely by the switch setting.  However, we
       set the drive status here anyway as a convenience.

   This routine returns the formatted unit status for the indicated drive unit.

   In hardware, the controller outputs the Address Unit command on the drive tag
   bus and the unit number on the drive control bus.  The addressed drive then
   responds by setting its internal "selected" flag.  The controller then
   outputs the Request Status command on the tag bug, and the selected drive
   returns its status on the control bus.  If a drive is selected but the heads
   are unloaded, the drive returns Not Ready and Busy status.  If no drive is
   selected, the control bus floats inactive.  This is interpreted by the
   controller as Not Ready status (because the drive returns an inactive Ready
   status).

   In simulation, an enabled but detached unit corresponds to "selected but
   heads unloaded," and a disabled unit corresponds to a non-existent unit.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The Attention, Read-Only, First Status, and Seek Check bits are stored
       in the unit status field.  The other status bits are determined
       dynamically (the Drive Fault bit is not simulated).

    2. The Drive Busy bit is set if the unit is in the seek phase.  In hardware,
       this bit indicates that the heads are not positioned over a track, i.e.,
       that a seek is in progress.  A Request Status command is accepted only
       when the controller is waiting for seek completion or for a new command.
       Therefore, the unit will be either in the seek phase or the idle phase,
       respectively, when status is returned.
