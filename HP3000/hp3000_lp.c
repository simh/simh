   The HP 30118A, 30127A, 30128A, and 30133A Line Printer Subsystems connect the
   2607A, 2613A, 2618A, and 2617A printers, respectively, to the HP 3000.  Each
   subsystem consists of a 30209A Line Printer Controller, employing a 30051A
   Universal Interface (Differential) and interconnecting cable, and an HP
   2607A (200 lines per minute), HP 2613 (300 lpm), HP 2617 (600 lpm), or HP
   2618 (1250 lpm) line printer.  These subsystems employ the Multiplexer
   Channel to achieve a 360 KB/second transfer rate from the CPU.

   This module simulates three hardware devices:

     - the HP 30051A Universal Interface (Differential)
     - the HP 30049C Diagnostic Hardware Assembly
     - the HP 2607A/13A/17A/18A line printer and 30209-60004 printer cable

   Available with either differential or TTL I/O logic levels, the Universal
   Interface (UI) provides a 16-bit bidirectional parallel connection between a
   device and the HP 3000 system.  Both direct and programmed I/O via the
   Multiplexer Channel are supported, word or byte transfers may be selected,
   and byte packing and unpacking is available.  In addition to the 16-bit data
   path, a five-bit control word is supplied to the device, and an eight-bit
   status word is returned.  Flexible configuration of interface operation is
   provided via ten jumpers, and eight different interrupt sources are
   available.  The Universal Interface is also used to connect the paper tape
   reader, punch, and card reader to the HP 3000.

   The Diagnostic Hardware Assembly (DHA) connects to the UI device connectors
   and provides a programmable loopback and configuration capability.  Five LEDs
   continuously display the device control word, and test points are provided to
   monitor the state of the 16-bit data path, the ten programmable jumper
   settings, and the Device Command, Device Flag, and Device End signals.
   Enabling the diagnostic mode simulates the installation of the DHA in place
   of the printer device cable.

   The interface supports a single line printer.  The supported printers are
   configured with Option 001, which provides a 128 (2607) or 96 (2613/17/18)
   character set.  Two output modes are provided: an expanded mode that is
   suitable for retaining printer output as a text file, and a compact mode that
   is suitable for sending the printer output to a host-connected physical
   printer.  An 8-channel (2607) or 12-channel (2613/17/18) Vertical Format Unit
   is supported, and custom VFU tape images may be loaded from properly
   formatted host-system text files.

   The printer supports realistic and optimized (fast) timing modes.  Realistic
   timing attempts to model the print buffer load and print-and-space operation
   delays inherent in the physical hardware.  For example, in REALTIME mode,
   output of longer lines takes more time than output of shorter lines, and
   spacing six lines takes approximately six times longer than spacing one line.
   In FASTTIME mode, all timings are reduced to be "just long enough" to satisfy
   MPE software driver requirements.


   In hardware, the ten UI configuration jumpers perform these functions:

   DEMAND is wired inversely to Device Flag, so DEMAND assertion is Device Flag
   denial and vice versa.  DEMAND dropping after STROBE assertion corresponds
   with Device Flag asserting after Device Command asserts, and DEMAND asserting
   after the printer is ready corresponds to Device Flag denying.

   Similarly, ONLINE is wired inversely to Device End, so the printer going
   offline asserts Device End, and READY is wired inversely to Device Status bit
   11, so bit 11 is asserted when the printer is not ready (either powered off
   or out of paper).

   The READY and ONLINE signals indicate the current state of the printer.
   READY asserts when printer power is on, no alarm condition (paper out, tape
   format error) exits, and the VFU has been initialized.  ONLINE asserts when
   READY is asserted and the Online button is pressed.  Therefore:

     ~ONLINE * ~READY = paper out or VFU error
     ~ONLINE *  READY = paper loaded and offline
      ONLINE * ~READY = (prohibited)
      ONLINE *  READY = paper loaded and online

   The printer DEMAND signal asserts when the printer is ready for data and
   denies when it is printing or slewing.  It also denies when the printer goes
   offline.  DEMAND is cross-connected to the Device Flag differential input,
   so that DEV FLAG is the complement of DEMAND, i.e., it asserts when the
   printer is busy and denies when the printer is available.

   The normal sequence starts with DEMAND asserted (i.e., DEV FLAG denied).  The
   interface asserts STROBE (DEV CMD), the printer denies DEMAND (asserts DEV
   FLAG), the interface denies STROBE (DEV CMD), and the printer then asserts
   DEMAND (denies DEV FLAG) when the character data is accepted or the print
   operation is complete.

   When the ON/OFFLINE button on the printer is pressed, the printer will not go
   offline (i.e., deny the ONLINE signal) if there are characters in the print
   buffer.  Instead, the offline condition is held off until an internal "allow
   offline" signal asserts.  This occurs when the print buffer is empty and the
   print cycle is inactive.  When ONLINE denies, DEMAND is inhibited, so the
   interface waits at the end of the handshake sequence for DEV FLAG to deny.
   Note that this holds off SR to the Multiplexer Channel, so the channel
   program waits.  When the printer is put back online, DEMAND asserts, so DEV
   FLAG denies, the handshake completes, SR asserts, and the interface returns
   to the idle condition to await the next command.

   This has implications for the SET OFFLINE and DETACH commands if they are
   issued while the print buffer contains data or the printer unit is busy
   executing a print action.

   The SET LP OFFLINE and SET LP DETACH commands check for data in the print
   buffer or a print operation in progress.  If either condition is true, they
   set their respective deferred-action flags and display "Command deferred."  A
   SHOW LP will show that the device is still online and attached.  Once
   simulation is resumed and the print operation completes, the printer is set
   offline or detached as requested.  No console message reports this, as it is
   assumed that the executing program will detect the condition and report
   accordingly.  A subsequent SHOW LP will indicate the new status.

   A SET LP ONLINE or ATTACH LP command when the corresponding deferred-action
   flag is set simply clears the flag.  In particular, an ATTACH LP command must
   not specify a new image filename; if one is specified while a deferred detach
   is in progress, the routine returns SCPE_NOFNC ("Command not allowed").

   A RESET LP command also clears the deferred-action flags and so clears any
   pending offline or detach.  However, it also clears the print buffer and
   terminates any print action in progress, so a SET LP OFFLINE or DETACH LP
   will succeed if issued subsequently.


   The Universal Interface responds to both direct I/O and programmed I/O from
   the Multiplexer Channel, as follows:

   Control Word Format (CIO and SIO Control word 2):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | M | R | irq reset | A |  device control   | X | S | B | I | T | device
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | M | R | irq reset | A |   function    | E | X | S | B | I | T | DHA
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | M | R | irq reset | A | -   -   -   - | F | X | S | B | I | T | printer
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     M = programmed master clear
     R = reset interrupts
     A = acquire data from device
     E = enable diagnostic hardware assembly function
     F = printer output character/format (0/1) code
     X = enable data transfer interrupt
     S = interrupt/device (0/1) status
     B = word/byte (0/1) transfer
     I = enable interrupts
     T = enable transfer timer

   IRQ Reset:

     000 = none
     001 = transfer timer and transfer error
     010 = I/O system
     011 = clear interface
     100 = data transfer completion
     101 = line ready (device status bit 8)
     110 = ready (device status bit 9)
     111 = not ready (device status bit 10)

   DHA Function:

     0000 = clear configuration registers (installs jumpers)
     0001 = remove jumper J2W2
     0010 = assert DEV END
     0011 = remove jumper J2W8
     0100 = set Transfer Error flip-flop
     0101 = remove jumper J2W4
     0110 = remove jumper J2W10
     0111 = remove jumper J2W6
     1000 = DEV FLAG follows DEV CMD or Control 6 (0/1)
     1001 = remove jumper J2W5
     1010 = assert CLEAR INTERFACE
     1011 = remove jumper J2W9
     1100 = Status 8-10 follow Control 6-8
              or master clear, power on, and power fail (0/1)
     1101 = remove jumper J2W1
     1110 = remove jumper J2W3
     1111 = remove jumper J2W7

   Bits 6-10 are the device control bits.  For the DHA, control bit 10 enables
   the function decoder.  The decoder is combinatorial and the registers are
   "ones-catching," so the function field must be set and then maintained while
   bit 10 is asserted and then denied.  For the line printer, control bit 10
   indicates whether character data (0) or format commands (1) will be output.
   Programmed control word 1 (IOCW) is not used.

   Setting control bit 15 starts (or restarts) the five-second transfer timer.
   Issuing a Reset Transfer Timer and Transfer Error Interrupts, a Master Reset,
   or a Reset Interrupts command stops the timer.  If the timer expires, a
   Transfer Timer interrupt occurs.


   Status Word Format (TIO and SIO Status):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | S | D | I | seqct | F | 0 | 0 |  dev irq  | X | C | Y | E | T | interrupt
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | S | D | I | seqct | F | 1 | 0 |         device status         | device
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     S = SIO OK
     D = direct I/O OK
     I = interrupt pending
     F = device flag
     X = data transfer interrupt
     C = clear interface interrupt
     Y = I/O system interrupt
     E = transfer error interrupt
     T = transfer timer interrupt
     L = online
     N = not ready
     V = VFU channel 12
     U = VFU channel 9

   Sequence Counter:

     00 = idle
     10 = request to device issued for word or 1st byte
     11 = device operation started
     01 = request to device issued for 2nd byte

   Device Interrupt Request Bits:

      8 = device status bit 8 interrupt (not used by the printer)
      9 = device status bit 9 interrupt (printer went online)
     10 = device status bit 10 interrupt (printer went offline)

   Control word bit 12 determines whether the interrupt status word (0) or the
   device status word (1) is returned.

   A transfer error occurs when the channel asserts XFERERROR to abort a
   transfer for a parity error or memory address out of bounds.  Device status
   bits assume the logic 1 state with the inputs disconnected (e.g., power off).


   Output Data Word Format (WIO and SIO Write):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - |    1st ASCII character    | - |    2nd ASCII character    | byte mode
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - | - |      ASCII character      | word mode
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - | - |        format word        | format
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The printer only uses seven data bits, so the MSB of each byte is ignored.
   If the printer's line length is exceeded during write operations, the
   buffered line will be printed, the paper will be advanced one line, and the
   buffer will be cleared to accept the character causing the overflow.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The Clear Interface Logic (CLRIL) signal inhibits SIO OK status.  The
       Card Reader/Punch Interface version of the UI does not assert the CLRIL
       signal in response to external CLEAR INTERFACE assertion; only a transfer
       error does.  Therefore, the SIO OK signal is not inhibited while the
       clear interface interrupt is present.  For this version, the external
       Clear Interface signal sets the CLR INF flip-flop, which sets the (C) bit
       in the status register and generates an interrupt, but otherwise has no
       effect on the interface logic.

       The standard version of the UI asserts CLRIL, and therefore inhibits SIO
       OK, for both the clear interface and transfer error conditions.

    2. Because the interface uses differential interface logic, the external
       sense of a signal may be inverted by exchanging the + and - connections.
       To accommodate this in simulation, separate variables are used for the
       internal and external states.  For example, "device_command" represents
       the internal state, while "device_command_out" represents the external
       state (which may be inverted from the internal state if jumper J2W10 is
       installed).

    3. The Universal Interface supports terminating channel transfers by
       asserting DEVEND, and the line printer cable connects the ONLINE output
       inversely to the Device End input, so that it is asserted when the
       printer is offline.  However, when the printer goes offline, it holds its
       DEMAND line denied, which keeps Device Flag asserted.  This hangs the
       transfer handshake in the Device_Flag_1/2 state until the printer goes
       online again.  As the interface recognizes Device End only in the
       Device_Command_1/2 state, DEVEND will never be asserted to terminate a
       channel transfer.

    4. In hardware, a paper-out condition is noted, but the line printer does
       not go offline until the top of the next form is reached.  This ensures
       that the current page is completed first.  By contrast, a torn-paper
       condition causes the printer to go offline at the completion of the
       current line.  In simulation, a DETACH is handled as a torn-paper
       condition.

    5. Slewing in expanded mode is performed by appending CR LF pairs to the
       character buffer and then writing the combined buffer to the printer
       output file.  The size of the buffer must accommodate the largest print
       line (136 characters) plus the largest possible slew (144 lines * 2
       characters per line).

/* Configuration jumpers.

   Various aspects of interface operation are configured by installing or
   removing jumpers contained within the connector hood of the device
   interconnection cable.  Jumpers are simulated by bits in the "jumper_set"
   word, with a 1 value representing "installed" and a 0 value representing
   "removed" (although in hardware installing a jumper pulls the corresponding
   signal down to 0).

   The Diagnostic Hardware Assembly provides programmatic configuration of the
   jumpers.  All jumpers are installed by executing a "clear registers" command,
   and then individual jumpers may be removed by executing the corresponding
   "remove jumper J2Wn" commands.  This is simulated by setting all of the bits
   in the "jumper_set" word and then selectively ANDing the word with
   complemented constants from the "jumper_map" table, thereby clearing
   individual bits.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In simulation, jumper W5 is not used.  The DATA IN signals are always
       latched when DEV FLAG asserts.  Always-transparent operation is not
       provided.

    2. In hardware, DHA control word bits 6-9 are wired to decoder input bits
       0-3.  As the 3000 uses decreasing bit-number significance, while the
       decoder chip uses increasing bit-number significance, the order of the
       functions in the "jumper_map" table reflect the reversed bit order of the
       index.  For example, index 0001 contains the function for decoder output
       8 (1000).

/* Universal interface.

   The universal interface is installed on the IOP and Multiplexer Channel buses
   and receives direct and programmed I/O commands from the IOP and Multiplexer
   Channel, respectively.  In simulation, the asserted signals on the buses are
   represented as bits in the inbound_signals set.  Each signal is processed
   sequentially in numerical order, and a set of similar outbound_signals is
   assembled and returned to the caller, simulating assertion of the
   corresponding backplane signals.

   After setting the control mode to establish word or byte mode, SIO data
   transfer between the interface and the connected device is initiated by a
   PWRITESTB or READNEXTWD order.  For direct I/O, a DWRITESTB or a DCONTSTB
   with the "acquire" bit set initiates a transfer.

   A sequencer governs the generation of the device handshake signals.  The
   handshake begins with the assertion of the Device Control signal.  In
   response, the device asserts the Device Flag signal.  The interface then
   denies Device Control, and the device denies Device Flag.  For a byte
   transfer, this sequence repeats automatically for the second byte.  Byte
   packing and unpacking is provided by the interface.

   Eight interrupt sources are provided and may be individually set by their
   associated conditions.  A master interrupt enable is provided by setting the
   appropriate control word bit, and the requesting sources may be cleared
   independently.  An interrupt acknowledgement from the IOP clears the master
   interrupt enable to prevent multiple sources from interrupting
   simultaneously.

   The status word returned by a DSTATSTB or PSTATSTB signal consists of
   interface status in the upper byte and either interrupt or device status in
   the lower byte, as selected by a control word bit.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In a hardware transfer abort, READNEXTWD or PWRITESTB causes the
       sequencer to transition to the Device_Command_1 state and set the Device
       End flip-flop, which asserts DEVEND to the multiplexer channel, and then
       the Device End flip-flop is cleared by ACKSR.  In simulation, ACKSR
       occurs before the PREADSTB or PWRITESTB that asserts DEVEND, so the state
       of the Device End flip-flop is saved in the ACKSR handler and is then
       checked in a subsequent PREADSTB or PWRITESTB to assert DEVEND.

    2. In hardware, the SETJMP signal is ignored, and the JMPMET signal is
       asserted continuously when enabled by CHANSO.

    3. In hardware, a power fail warning (PFWARN) is asserted continuously from
       detection until power is lost.  In simulation, the "power_warning" flag
       is set by a PFWARN assertion and is cleared by a power-on reset.  PFWARN
       is used only by the DHA.

/* Service the transfer handshake.

   This service routine is called once for each state of the device transfer
   handshake.  The handshake sequencer schedules the transfer events with the
   appropriate delays.  If no delay is required, the service routine is entered
   directly from the sequencer.  Otherwise, an event is scheduled, and the
   routine is entered when the event time expires.

   Jumper W10 determines the output polarity of the DEV CMD signal to the
   device, and jumpers W2 and W6 determine the input edges of the DEV FLAG
   signal from the device used to assert and deny the Device Flag, as follows:

     Jumper  Interpretation when removed    Interpretation when installed
     ------  -----------------------------  -----------------------------
       W10   DEV CMD polarity is normal     DEV CMD polarity is inverted

       W2    Flag asserts on leading edge   Flag asserts on trailing edge

       W6    Flag denies on trailing edge   Flag denies on leading edge

   Note that if jumpers W2 and W6 are not installed or removed in pairs, the
   Device Flag asserts and denies on the same edge of the DEV FLAG signal.  In
   this case, the service routine sets the flag on the first call and clears the
   flag on the second call without requiring a change in the incoming signal.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The "device_command_out" and "device_flag_in" variables represent the
       states of the DEV CMD and DEV FLAG signal lines.  Edge detection for the
       Device Flag is accomplished by comparing the current state to the prior
       state.

    2. If the routine was entered by event timer expiration, the handshake
       sequencer must be called explicitly, and any returned backplane signals
       must be asserted explicitly.  If the routine was called directly, the
       sequencer is responsible for asserting backplane signals as required.

    3. This routine may be called with a NULL "uptr" parameter to update the
       saved last state of the "device_flag_in" variable.  The NULL value
       indicates that this is not part of the normal handshake sequence.

/* Start or continue the data transfer handshake.

   This routine implements the two-wire data transfer handshake with the device.
   For each word or byte transferred, the Device Command signal from the
   interface and the Device Flag signal from the device assume these states:

     Command     Flag         State          Next State
      State      State        Action         Transition
     --------  --------  ----------------  --------------
     denied    denied    device idle       Command sets
     asserted  denied    device started    Flag sets
     asserted  asserted  device completed  Command clears
     denied    asserted  interface idle    Flag clears

   In hardware, a two-bit gray counter implements a four-state sequencer, with
   three states assigned as follows for a word transfer:

                                Command     Flag
     State  State Action         State      State   Next State Transition
     -----  ------------------  --------  --------  ---------------------
      0 0   idle                denied    denied    read or write command
      1 0   word requested      asserted  denied    Flag sets
      1 1   word started        denied    asserted  Flag clears
      0 0   word completed      denied    denied    ---

   For a two-byte transfer, the states are:

                                Command     Flag
     State  State Action         State      State   Next State Transition
     -----  ------------------  --------  --------  ---------------------
      0 0   idle                denied    denied    read or write command
      1 0   1st byte requested  asserted  denied    Flag sets
      1 1   1st byte started    denied    asserted  Flag clears
      1 0   1st byte completed  asserted  denied    Flag sets
            2nd byte requested
      0 0   2nd byte started    denied    asserted  Flag clears
      0 0   2nd byte completed  denied    denied    ---

   The presence of the asserted Device Flag when the count is 00 differentiates
   between the "2nd byte started" and "operation completed" conditions.

   In simulation, these last two conditions are assigned to separate states, as
   follows:

     Hdwe      Simulation     Command     Flag
     State       State         State      State
     -----  ----------------  --------  --------
      0 0   Idle              denied    denied
      1 0   Device_Command_1  asserted  denied
      1 1   Device_Flag_1     denied    asserted
      1 0   Device_Command_2  asserted  denied
      0 0   Device_Flag_2     denied    asserted
      0 0   Idle              denied    denied

   To provide the proper values to appear in the Sequence Counter field of the
   status word, a mapping array is used to supply the value 00 for the
   Device_Flag_2 state.

   The device service is scheduled after each state transition, except the
   return to the idle state, to detect the change in the Device Command signal
   or to schedule the change in the Device Flag.  The device determines whether
   the service is entered immediately or after an event time expires.

   For the diagnostic device, the service routine is entered immediately for all
   transitions.  If the DHA is configured for flag-follows-command mode, the
   full handshake cycle executes before returning from the routine.  If it is
   configured for flag-follows-control-6, the routine returns after the Idle-to-
   Device_Command_1 state transition to wait for control word bit 6 to be set.
   When it is, the routine is reentered, transitions from Device_Command_1 to
   Device_Flag_1, and then returns to wait for control word bit 6 to be cleared.
   When it is, the routine is entered and completes the transition from
   Device_Flag_1 to the Idle state (assuming a word transfer).

   For the printer device, the service routine is entered immediately for Device
   Flag assertions, but flag denials are scheduled with a delay corresponding to
   the printer operation time.  The initial handshake entry transitions from
   Idle to Device_Command_1, calls the service routine, which sets Device Flag,
   transitions to Device_Flag_1, schedules the service routine, and returns to
   wait for the event timer to expire.  When it does, the event service routine
   is entered, which clears Device Flag and calls this routine to continue the
   handshake.  The routine transitions from Device_Flag_1 to Idle to complete
   the handshake sequence.

   Summarizing:
                                         Diagnostic Service  Diagnostic Service
     State             Printer Service    Flag follows Cmd   Flag follows cont.6
     ----------------  ----------------  ------------------  -------------------
     Device_Command_1  set Flag          set Flag            wait for Control.6
     Device_Flag_1     wait for service  clear Flag          wait for Control.6
     Device_Command_2  set Flag          set Flag            wait for Control.6
     Device_Flag_2     wait for service  clear Flag          wait for Control.6

   If the device asserts the DEV END signal in response to Device Command, the
   Device End flip-flop is set, and the sequencer is reset back to the Idle
   state to abort the transfer.  DEV END assertion in any other state is ignored
   until Device Command is set.

   If jumper W3 is installed, DEV CMD is pulsed for 8 microseconds by asserting
   Device Command and scheduling the pulse timer to deny it when the event timer
   expires.

   A DWRITESTB or PWRITESTB signal stores a 16-bit value in the data output
   register.  In word mode, the value is presented continuously on the 16 DATA
   OUT lines.  In byte mode, the upper byte in the data output register is
   presented on both bytes of the DATA OUT lines until the Device Flag sets to
   indicate that the device has accepted the first byte, whereupon the full
   16-bit value is presented on the DATA OUT lines.  The result is that the
   upper byte and then the lower byte appears on the lower byte of the DATA OUT
   lines.

   During byte-mode read cycles, the previously stored full 16-bit output value
   is presented on the DATA OUT lines if J2W7 is removed.  If J2W7 is installed,
   the upper byte and then the lower byte appears on the lower byte.  In other
   words, a byte read with J2W7 installed causes the DATA OUT lines to assume
   the same values in sequence that occur during a byte write.  This is used by
   the diagnostic to test the DATA OUT multiplexer.

   A read is initiated by the READNEXTWD signal or by setting the Acquire bit in
   the control word.  Device Command sets in response.  While Device Command is
   set, the data input register is transparent and passes the value on the Data
   In lines through.  When Device Flag sets, the value on the DATA IN lines is
   latched in the register.  A DREADSTB or PREADSTB signal then enables the
   register onto the IOP Data bus.  With J2W5 installed, the data in register is
   always transparent, and a DREADSTB or PREADSTB signal presents the current
   value on the DATA IN lines to the IOP Data bus.

   In word mode with J2W5 removed, 16-bit data presented at the DATA IN lines is
   passed through the data input register while Device Command is set and is
   latched when the Device Flag sets.  In byte mode with J2W5 removed, the value
   presented on the lower byte of the DATA IN lines is presented to both bytes
   of the data input register, passed through while Device Command is set, and
   latched into both bytes of the register when the Device Flag sets to indicate
   that the device has supplied the first byte.  When Device Command sets for
   the second byte, the value presented on the lower byte of the DATA IN lines
   is presented to the lower byte of the data input register, passed through
   while Device Command is set, and latched into the lower byte when the Device
   Flag sets to indicate that the device has supplied the second byte.  The
   result is that the data input register presents the first byte in both bytes
   of the register and then the second byte presents as the lower byte of the
   register, resulting in a packed 16-bit value.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, the sequencer moves from state 2 through state 3 to state 0
       when the device flag denies at the end of a word transfer.  For a packed
       byte transfer, the sequencer moves from state 3 to state 0 when the
       device flag asserts for the second byte, with logic holding off the
       "operation done" signal until the flag denies.

       In simulation, the sequencer moves on flag denial directly from
       Device_Flag_1 to Idle for a word transfer and on flag assertion from
       Device_Command_2 to Device_Flag_2 and then on flag denial to Idle for a
       second byte transfer.  The sequence count reported in a status return is
       0 for Device_Flag_2, preserving the appearance of returning to state 0
       while the internal Device_Flag_2 state holds off the "operation done"
       signal.

    2. In hardware, a DEV END signal asserts the Q2 and Q3 qualifiers, enabling
       the sequence counter to proceed through the state sequence back to the
       idle state.  In simulation, the sequencer state is set directly back to
       Idle.

    3. In hardware, with jumper W5 out, the DATA IN latches are transparent in
       the Device_Command_1 and Device_Command_2 states and are latched
       otherwise, i.e., when Device Flag asserts.  With jumper W5 in, the
       latches are transparent always, and a read gets the real-time state of
       the DATA IN lines.  In simulation, the read register is set when Device
       Flag asserts; transparency is not simulated.

    4. The diagnostic tests the byte unpacking and packing multiplexers on the
       DATA OUT and DATA IN lines, so we must simulate the multiplexing
       accurately with respect to the intermediate values before the handshake
       is complete.

/* Service the transfer handshake for the printer.

   The printer transfer service is called to output a character to the printer
   buffer or to output a format command that causes the buffered line to be
   printed with specified paper movement.

   In hardware, the interface places a character or format code on the lower
   seven data out lines and asserts STROBE (DEV CMD) to the printer.  The
   printer responds by denying DEMAND (asserting DEV FLAG).  The interface then
   denies STROBE and waits for the printer to reassert DEMAND (deny DEV FLAG) to
   indicate that the buffer load or print operation is complete.

   In simulation, this service routine is called twice for each transfer.  It is
   called directly with Device Command set and then after a variable delay with
   Device Command clear.  In response to the former call, the routine sets the
   Device Flag, loads the character buffer or prints the buffered line, and then
   sets up an event delay corresponding to the operation performed.  In response
   to the latter call, the routine clears the Device Flag and then clears the
   event delay time, so that the routine will be reentered directly when Device
   Command sets again.

   If a SET LP OFFLINE command or a DETACH LP command simulating an out-of-paper
   condition is given, the printer will not honor the command immediately if
   data exists in the print buffer or the printer is currently printing a line.
   In this case, the action is deferred until the service routine is entered to
   complete a print operation.  At that point, the printer goes offline with
   DEMAND denied.  This leaves the transfer handshake incomplete.  When the
   printer is placed back online, this routine is called to assert DEMAND and
   conclude the handshake.

   Control word bit 10 determines whether the code on the data out lines is
   interpreted as a character (0) or a format command (1).  Character data is
   loaded into the buffer; if the line length is exceeded, the printer
   automatically prints the buffer contents, advances the paper one line, and
   stores the new character in the empty buffer.  If a control character is sent
   but the printer cannot print it, a space is loaded in its place.

   A format command causes the current buffer to be printed, and then the paper
   is advanced by a prescribed amount.  Two output modes are provided: compact
   and expanded.

   In compact mode, a printed line is terminated by a CR LF pair, but subsequent
   line spacing is performed by LFs alone.  Also, a top-of-form request will
   emit a FF character instead of the number of LFs required to reach the top of
   the next form, and overprinting is handled by emitting a lone CR at the end
   of the line.  This mode is used when the printer output file will be sent to
   a physical printer connected to the host.

   In expanded mode, paper advance is handled solely by emitting CR LF pairs.
   Overprinting is handled by merging characters in the buffer.  This mode is
   used where the printer output file will be saved or manipulated as a text
   file.

   The format commands recognized by the printer are:

     0 x x 0 0 0 0 -- slew 0 lines (suppress spacing) after printing
          ...
     0 x x 1 1 1 1 -- slew 15 lines after printing

   and:

     1 x x 0 0 0 0 -- slew to VFU channel 1 after printing
          ...
     1 x x 1 0 1 1 -- slew to VFU channel 12 after printing

   A command to slew to a VFU channel that is not punched or to a VFU channel
   other than those defined for the printer will cause a tape fault, and the
   printer will go offline; setting the printer back online will clear the
   fault.  Otherwise, LFs or a FF (compact mode) or CR LF pairs (expanded mode)
   will be added to the buffer to advance the paper the required number of
   lines.

   Not all printers can overprint.  A request to suppress spacing on a printer
   that cannot (e.g., the HP 2607) is treated as a request for single spacing.

   If the stream write fails, an error message is displayed on the simulation
   console, a printer alarm condition is set (which takes the printer offline),
   and SCPE_IOERR is returned to cause a simulation stop to give the user the
   opportunity to fix the problem.  Simulation may then be resumed, either with
   the printer set back online if the problem is fixed, or with the printer
   remaining offline if the problem is uncorrectable.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Because attached files are opened in binary mode, newline translation
       (i.e., from LF to CR LF) is not performed by the host system.  Therefore,
       we write explicit CR LF pairs to end lines, even in compact mode, as
       required for fidelity to HP peripherals.  If bare LFs are used by the
       host system, the printer output file must be postprocessed to remove the
       CRs.

    2. Overprinting in expanded mode is simulated by merging the lines in the
       buffer.  A format command to suppress spacing resets the buffer index but
       saves the previous buffer length as a "high water mark" that will be
       extended if the overlaying line is longer.  This process may be repeated
       as many times as desired before issuing a format command that prints the
       buffer.

       When overlaying characters, if a space overlays a printing character, a
       printing character overlays a space, or a printing character overlays
       itself, then the printing character is retained.  Otherwise, an
       "overprint character" (which defaults to DEL, but can be changed by the
       user) replaces the character in the buffer.

    3. Printers that support 12-channel VFUs treat the VFU format command as
       modulo 16.  Printers that support 8-channel VFUs treat the command as
       modulo 8.

    4. As a convenience to the user, the printer output file is flushed when a
       TOF operation is performed.

    5. The user may examine the TFAULT and PFAULT registers to determine why the
       printer went offline.

    6. The transfer service may be called with a null pointer to update the
       potential change in the flag state.

    7. If printing is attempted with the printer offline, this routine will be
       called with STROBE asserted (device_command_in TRUE) and DEMAND denied
       (device_flag_in TRUE).  The printer ignores STROBE if DEMAND is not
       asserted, so we simply return in this case.  This will hang the handshake
       until the printer is set online, and we are reentered with DEMAND
       asserted.

/* Attach the printer image file.

   The specified file is attached to the indicated unit.  This is the simulation
   equivalent of loading paper into the printer and pressing the ONLINE button.
   The transition from offline to online causes an interrupt.

   A new image file may be requested by giving the "-N" switch to the attach
   command.  If an existing file is specified with "-N", it will be cleared; if
   specified without "-P", printer output will be appended to the end of the
   existing file content.  In all cases, the paper is positioned at the top of
   the form.

   As a special case, a detach (out-of-paper condition) that has been deferred
   until printing completes may be cancelled by giving an attach command without
   a filename, i.e., ATTACH LP.  If a filename is given, but the detach is still
   pending, the routine returns a "Command not allowed" error.

    1. If we are called during a RESTORE command to reattach a file previously
       attached when the simulation was SAVEd, the device status and file
       position are not altered.

    2. The pointer to the appropriate event delay times is set in case we are
       being called during a RESTORE command (the assignment is redundant
       otherwise).

/* Detach the printer image file.

   The specified file is detached from the indicated unit.  This is the
   simulation equivalent to unloading the paper from the printer or the printer
   running out of paper.  The out-of-paper condition cause a paper fault alarm,
   and the printer goes offline.  The transition from online to offline causes
   an interrupt.

   When the printer runs out of paper, it will not go offline until characters
   present in the buffer are printed and paper motion stops.  In simulation,
   entering a DETACH LP command while the printer is busy will defer the file
   detach until the current print operation completes.


   Implementation notes:

    1. During simulator shutdown, this routine is called for all three units,
       not just the printer unit.  The printer must be detached, even if a
       detach has been deferred, to ensure that the file is closed properly.  We
       do this in response to a detach request with the SIM_SW_SHUT switch

   button on the printer.

   If the printer is being taken offline, the buffer is checked to see if any
   characters are present.  If they are, or if the printer unit is currently
   scheduled (i.e., executing a print operation), the offline request is

   to inform the user.  Otherwise, the unit is set offline, DEMAND is denied,

   If the printer is being put online, the unit must be attached (i.e., paper
   must be loaded), or the command is rejected.  If paper is present, the unit
   is set online, and any tape fault present is cleared.  If the sequencer
   indicates an incomplete handshake, as would occur if paper ran out while
   printing, the transfer service is called to complete the handshake by
   asserting DEMAND.  Otherwise, DEMAND is asserted explicitly, and DEV END is
   denied.

   Transitions between the offline and online state cause interrupts, and INTREQ
   is asserted to the IOP if a transition occurred (but not, e.g., for a SET LP
   OFFLINE command where the printer is already offline).

   This routine is called when the MASTER CLEAR signal is asserted to the

   for a Programmed Master Clear or IORESET assertion, and FALSE if the routine
   is called for a RESET or RESET LP command.  In the latter case, the presence
   of the "-P" switch indicates that this is a power-on reset.  In either case,
   the interface reset has already been performed; this routine is responsible
   for resetting the printer only.

   In hardware, asserting MASTER CLEAR:

     - clears the input buffer without printing
     - finishes printing the current line and performs any stored VFU action
     - inhibits DEMAND for approximately three milliseconds

   In simulation, the buffer index is reset, a tape fault is cleared, a paper
   fault is determined by the paper status, and any deferred offline command is
   cleared.  Printing is always "complete" at the point of entry, as the actual
   file write is instantaneous from the simulation perspective.  DEMAND is not
   altered, as the printer is "ready" as soon as the command completes.  DEV END
   is reset to the offline status (asserted if the printer is offline, denied if
   online).

   In addition, if a power-on reset (RESET -P) is done, the original FASTTIME
   settings are restored, the standard VFU tape is loaded, and the power failure
   warning is cleared.

   The printer cable inversely connects DEMAND to the Device Flag input and
   ONLINE to the Device End input.  As both deny when the printer goes offline
   and assert when the printer goes online, Device Flag and Device End assert
   and deny, respectively.

   If the printer goes offline with an operation in progress, Device Flag will
   remain asserted, and the handshake sequencer will remain in the Device_Flag_1
   or Device_Flag_2 state until the printer is set online again.  The transfer
   service routine is informed of these state changes, so that the handshake can
   complete when the printer is again set online.


   Implementation notes:

    1. When called with a NULL parameter, the transfer service routine will
       update its internal device flag state but will take no other action.
       When called with a unit pointer, the routine continues the handshake
       sequence.

/* Load the VFU.

   The printer VFU is loaded either with a custom tape image stored in the file
   associated with the stream "vf" or with the standard 66-line tape if the
   stream is NULL.  The "uptr" parameter points to the printer unit.

   The standard VFU tape (1535-2655 for the 8-channel HP 2607 and 2613-80001 for
   the 12-channel HP 2613, 2617, and 2618) defines the channels as:

     Chan  Description
     ----  --------------
       1   Top of form
       2   Bottom of form
       3   Single space
       4   Double space
       5   Triple space
       6   Half page
       7   Quarter page
       8   Sixth page
       9   Bottom of form

   ...with channels 10-12 uncommitted.  A custom tape must dedicate channel 1 to
   the top-of-form, but the other channels may be defined as desired.

   A custom tape file starts with a VFU definition line and then contains one
   channel-definition line for each line of the form.  The number of lines
   establishes the form length.

   A semicolon appearing anywhere on a line begins a comment, and the semicolon
   and all following characters are ignored.  Zero-length lines, including lines
   beginning with a semicolon, are ignored.

   Note that a line containing one or more blanks is not a zero-length line, so,
   for example, the line " ; a comment starting in column 2" is not ignored.

   The first (non-ignored) line in the file is a VFU definition line of this
   exact form:

     VFU=<punch characters>,<no-punch character>{,<title>}

   ...where:

     Parameter           Description
     ------------------  -------------------------------------------------------
     punch characters    a string of one or more characters used interchangeably
                         to represent a punched location

     no-punch character  a single character representing a non-punched location

     title               an optional descriptive string printed by the SHOW LP
                         VFU command ("Custom VFU" is used by default)

   If the "VFU" line is missing or not of the correct form, then "Format error"
   status is returned, and the VFU tape is not changed.

   The remaining (non-ignored) lines define the channels punched for each line
   of the printed form.  The line format consists of a sequence of punch,
   no-punch, and "other" characters in channel order.  Each punch or no-punch
   character defines a channel state, starting with channel 1 and proceeding
   left-to-right until all channels for the VFU are defined; if the line
   terminates before all channels are defined, the remaining channels are set to
   the no-punch state.  Any "other" characters (i.e., neither a punch character
   nor a no-punch character) are ignored and may be used freely to delineate the
   tape channels.

   Examples using the standard 66-line tape definition for an 8-channel VFU:


     ; the VFU definition                 |   VFU=1234578,  ; no-punch is a ' '
     VFU=1,0,a binary tape image          |
                                          |   1             ; top of form
     ; the channel definitions            |     345         ; form line 1
                                          |     3           ; form line 2
     10111111   ; top of form             |     34          ; form line 3
     00100000   ; single space            |     3 5         ; form line 4
     0011       ; channels 5-8 no-punch   |     34          ; form line 5
                                          |
     -------------------------------------+-------------------------------------
                                          |
     VFU=X,-,blanks are "others"          |   VFU=TO,.,brackets are "others"
                                          |   ; 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
     X  -  X  X  X  X  X  X   ; line 1    |   ;--- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
     -  -  X  -  -  -  -  -   ; line 2    |    [T]  .  [O] [O] [O] [O] [O] [O]
     -  -  X  X  -  -  -  -   ; line 3    |     .   .  [O]  .   .   .   .   .
                                          |     .   .  [O] [O]  .   .   .   .


   On entry, the "vf" parameter determines whether the standard tape or a custom
   tape is to be loaded.  If "vf" is NULL, a standard 66-line tape is generated
   and stored in the tape buffer.  Otherwise, a custom tape file is read,
   parsed, and assembled VFU entries are stored in the tape buffer.  After
   generation or a successful tape load, the buffer is copied to the VFU array,
   the form length is set, the current line is reset to the top-of-form, and the
   state of VFU channels 9 and 12 are set into the device status.


   Implementation notes:

    1. VFU array entries 1-n correspond to form print lines 1-n.  Entry 0 is the
       logical OR of all of the other entries and is used during VFU format
       command processing to determine if a punch is present somewhere in a
       given channel.
