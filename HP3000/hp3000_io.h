/* I/O bus signals.

   The INBOUND_SIGNAL and OUTBOUND_SIGNAL declarations mirror the hardware
   signals that are received and asserted, respectively, by the I/O interfaces
   on the IOP, selector/multiplexer channel, and power buses.  A set of one or
   more signals forms an INBOUND_SET or OUTBOUND_SET that is sent to or returned
   from a device interface.  Under simulation, the IOP and channels dispatch one
   INBOUND_SET to the target device interface per I/O cycle.  The interface
   returns a combined OUTBOUND_SET and data value to the caller.

   Hardware allows parallel action for concurrent signals.  Under simulation, a
   "concurrent" set of signals is processed sequentially by the interface in
   order of ascending numerical value.

   In addition, some signals must be asserted asynchronously, e.g., in response
   to an event service call.  The IOP and channels provide asynchronous
   assertion via function calls for the INTREQ, REQ, SRn, and CHANSR signals.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The enumerations describe signals.  A set of signals normally would be
       modeled as an unsigned integer, as a set may contain more than one
       signal.  However, we define a set as the enumeration, as the "gdb"
       debugger has special provisions for an enumeration of discrete bit values
       and will display the set in "ORed" form.

    2. The null set -- NO_SIGNALS -- cannot be defined as an enumeration
       constant because the C language has a single name space for all
       enumeration constants, so separate "no inbound signals" and "no outbound
       signals" identifiers would be required, and because including them would
       require handlers for them in "switch" statements, which is undesirable.
       Therefore, we define NO_SIGNALS as an explicit integer 0, so that it is
       compatible with both enumerations.

    3. Outbound signal values are restricted to the upper 16 bits to allow the
       combined signal/data value to fit in 32 bits.

    4. Inbound and outbound signal definitions are separated to allow for future
       inbound expansion, if necessary.

    5. In hardware, the IOP encodes direct I/O commands as a 3-bit IOCMD signal
       set on the IOP bus.  Each device interface decodes these signals into
       individual strobes to control the logic.  Under simulation, the IOCMD
       values are decoded by the IOP into individual signals for inclusion in
       the INBOUND_SIGNAL set that is passed to the interfaces.

    6. The ACKSR signal must come before the programmed I/O and TOGGLESR
       signals, as they may set an interface's Service Request flip-flop.

    7. The READNEXTWD signal must come after PREADSTB, as the former overwrites
       the input data word used by the latter.

    8. The TOGGLEnXFER signals must come after PREADSTB and PWRITESTB and before
       READNEXTWD, so that the strobes can test the interface's Device End
       flip-flop before the toggles can reset it.

    9. The EOT signal must come after PREADSTB and PWRITESTB and before the
       TOGGLEnXFER signals.  The former condition is required for the SCMB to
       return the correct EOT count, and the latter is required for the DS to
       set its End-of-Data flip-flop correctly.

   10. The SETINT signal must come before, and the TOGGLESIOOK signal must come
       after, the PSTATSTB signal so that the status of the interrupt request
       and SIO Busy flip-flops can be reported correctly.

   11. The CHANSO signal must come after all programmed I/O signals, as it is
       used by channel devices to assert CHANSR when needed.

/* I/O macros.

   The following macros are useful in device interface signal handlers and unit
   service routines.  The parameter definition symbols employed are:

     P = a priority set value
     S = an INBOUND_SET or OUTBOUND_SET value
     L = an INBOUND_SIGNAL value
     D = an outbound 16-bit data value
     C = a SIGNALS_DATA value
     B = a DIB value

   A priority set is an unsigned value, where each bit represents an assertion
   of some nature (e.g., I/O signals, interrupt requests, etc.), and the
   position of the bit represents its priority, which increases from LSB to MSB.
   The IOPRIORITY macro isolates the highest-priority bit from the set.  It does
   this by ANDing the value with its two's complement; only the lowest-order bit
   will differ.  For example (bits are numbered here from the LSB):

     priority set :  ...0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (bits 6, 8, and 9 are asserted)
     one's compl  :  ...1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1
     two's compl  :  ...1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
     ANDed value  :  ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (bit 6 is highest priority)

   If the request set indicates requests by 0 bits, rather than 1 bits, the
   IOPRIORITY macro must be called with the one's complement of the bits.

   The IONEXTSIG macro isolates the next inbound signal in sequence to process
   from the inbound signal set S.

   The IOCLEARSIG macro removes the processed signal L from the inbound signal
   set S.

   The IORETURN macro forms the 32-bit combined outbound signal set and data
   value to be returned by an interface from the signal set S and the 16-bit
   data value D.

   The IOSIGNALS macro isolates the outbound signal set from a 32-bit combined
   status and data value value C.

   The IODATA macro isolates the 16-bit data value from a 32-bit combined signal
   set and data value value C.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The IOPRIORITY macro implements two's complement explicitly, rather than
       using a signed negation, to be compatible with machines using a
       sign-magnitude integer format.  "gcc" and "clang" optimize the complement
       and add to a single NEG instruction on x86 machines.

/* I/O structures.

   The Device Information Block (DIB) allows devices to be relocated in the
   machine's I/O space.  Each DIB contains a pointer to the device controller
   interface routine, values corresponding to hardware jumpers on the controller
   (e.g., device number), and flip-flops that indicate the interrupt and channel
   service states.

   For fast access during I/O, interrupt, and channel service requests, devices
   are accessed via indexed tables.  The index employed depends on the
   application.  For example, I/O commands are routed via a table that is
   indexed by device number.  The tables are built during the instruction
   execution prelude by scanning the DIBs of all devices and placing pointers to
   the DIBs into the tables at the entries associated with the index values.
   Between execution runs, the user may reassign device properties, so the
   tables must be rebuilt each time.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The device number (DEVNO) bus is eight bits in width, and the CPU
       microcode, the IOP, and the device controllers all support device numbers
       up to 255.  However, MPE limits the size of the device reference table to
       correspond with a device number of 127, while the CPU reserves memory
       that would correspond to device numbers 0-2.  As a result, most device
       controllers provide only seven-bit configurable device numbers.  One
       exception is the Selector Channel Maintenance Board.  The Selector
       Channel diagnostic tests programmable device numbers > 127, which the
       SCMB provides via bits 8-15 of the counter/buffer register, although only
       seven preset jumpers are provided to set the standard device number for
       the board.

    2. The device_number, service_request_number, and interrupt_priority fields
       could be smaller than the defined 32-bit sizes, but IA-32 processors
       execute instructions with 32-bit operands much faster than those with
       16- or 8-bit operands.
