   The HP 30129A Cartridge Disc Subsystem connects the 7905A, 7906A, 7920A, and
   7925A disc drives to the HP 3000.  The subsystem consists of a 30229B
   Cartridge Disc Interface, a 13037D Multiple-Access Disc Controller ("MAC"),
   and from one to eight MAC drives.  The subsystem uses the Selector Channel to
   achieve a 937.5 KB/second transfer rate to the CPU.

   The disc controller connects from one to eight HP 7905 (15 MB), 7906 (20 MB),
   7920 (50 MB), or 7925 (120 MB) disc drives to interfaces installed in from
   one to eight CPUs.  The drives use a common command set and present data to
   the controller synchronously at a 468.75 kiloword per second (2.133
   microseconds per word) data rate.

   The disc interface is used to connect the HP 3000 CPU to the 13037's device
   controller.  While the controller supports multiple-CPU systems, the HP 3000
   does not use this capability.

   This module simulates a 30229B interface connected to a 13037D controller;
   the controller simulation is provided by the hp_disclib module.  From one to
   eight drives may be connected, and drive types may be freely intermixed.  A
   unit that is enabled but not attached appears to be a connected drive that
   does not have a disc pack in place.  A unit that is disabled appears to be
   disconnected.  An extra unit for the use of the disc controller library is
   also allocated.

   In hardware, the controller runs continuously in one of three states: in the
   Poll Loop (idle state), in the Command Wait Loop (wait state), or in command
   execution (busy state).  In simulation, the controller is run only when a
   command is executing or when a transition into or out of the two loops might
   occur.  Internally, the controller handles these transitions:

     - when a command other than End terminates (busy => wait)
     - when the End command terminates (busy => idle)
     - when a command timeout occurs (wait => idle)
     - when a parameter timeout occurs (busy => idle)
     - when a seek completes (if idle, and interrupts are enabled: idle => wait)

   The interface must call the controller library to handle these transitions:

     - when a command is received from the CPU (idle or wait => busy)
     - when interrupts are enabled (if idle and drive Attention, idle => wait)

   In addition, each transition to the wait state must check for a pending
   command, and each transition to the idle state must check for both a pending
   command and a drive with Attention status asserted.

   While the controller is in the busy state, command execution is broken up
   into a series of phases.  Phase transitions are scheduled on the drive units
   for commands that access the drives and on the controller unit otherwise.
   The interface unit service routine must call the disc controller to inform it
   of these events.


   The disc interface responds to direct and programmed I/O instructions, as
   follows:

   Control Word Format (CIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | M | R | T | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     M = master reset
     R = reset interrupts
     T = test mode

   Test mode inhibits the flag bus signals.  This allows the diagnostic to
   exercise the interface without causing the disc controller to react.


   Control Word Format (SIO Control):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - | W |  word 1
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                 disc controller command word                  |  word 2
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     W = set the Wait flip-flop

   The command opcode is the disc controller command to execute.  If the command
   takes or returns parameters, an SIO Write or Read must follow the Control
   order to supply or receive them.


   Status Word Format (TIO and SIO Status):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | S | T | I |termination status | -   -   -   - |  unit number  |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     S = SIO OK
     T = test mode is enabled (also DIO OK)
     I = interrupt request

   The termination status and unit number report the success or failure of the
   last disc controller command.  Also, note that the test mode flip-flop output
   is reported as DIO OK.  This means that RIO and WIO are inhibited unless test
   mode is set.


   Output Data Word Format (WIO and SIO Write):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                  data buffer register value                   |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


   Input Data Word Format (RIO and SIO Read):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                  data buffer register value                   |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


   Disc read or write commands may transfer up to 4K words with a single SIO
   Read or Write order.  Chained orders are necessary if longer transfers are
   required.

   The interface allows the channel to retry a failed transfer without CPU
   intervention.  The controller asserts the DVEND signal for transfer errors
   that it considers retryable (e.g., a disc read error).  A channel program can
   detect this condition via a Conditional Jump order, which will succeed for
   each retryable failure until the retry count expires.

   Unusually among HP 3000 interfaces, this device reacts to the PFWARN signal.
   A pending power failure will abort the current disc transfer and channel
   program, so that the operating system will know to retry the transfer once
   power has been restored.


   Implementation notes:

    1. As only a single interface connected to the disc controller is supported,
       the interface select address jumpers are not simulated.  Instead, the
       interface behaves as though it is always selected and does not process
       the SELIF and DSCIF functions from the controller.

    2. In hardware, jumper W1 selects whether the interface should assert the
       CLEAR signal to the disc controller when the interface is preset.  This
       jumper is needed in a multiple-interface system so that only one
       interface clears the controller.  The simulation does check the state of
       jumper W1, but as only a single interface is supported, the jumper
       position is hard-coded as ENABLED rather than being configurable via the
       user interface.

    3. Several of the hardware flip-flops that directly drive flag signals to
       the controller are modeled in simulation by setting and clearing the
       corresponding bits in the flags word itself.

    4. The simulation provides REALTIME and FASTTIME options.  FASTTIME settings
       may be altered via the register interface.  Performing a power-on reset
       (RESET -P) will restore the original FASTTIME values.

    5. This simulation provides diagnostic override settings to allow complete
       testing coverage via the offline disc diagnostic.  See the comments in
       the disc controller library for details of this capability.

/* Disc controller interface.

   The interface is installed on the IOP and Selector Channel buses and receives
   direct and programmed I/O commands from the IOP and Selector Channel,
   respectively.  In simulation, the asserted signals on the buses are
   represented as bits in the inbound_signals set.  Each signal is processed
   sequentially in numerical order, and a set of similar outbound_signals is
   assembled and returned to the caller, simulating assertion of the
   corresponding backplane signals.

   MAC disc controller commands take from 0 to 2 parameters and return from 0 to
   7 status words.  All communication with the disc controller is via programmed
   I/O.  Direct I/O is used only to communicate with the interface.

   Commands consist of a Control I/O order optionally followed by a one- or
   two-word Write order to supply the parameters.  Commands that return status
   consist of a Control order followed by a Read order to send the status.
   Controller command opcodes are carried in the IOAW of a programmed I/O
   Control order.  The IOCW is not used, except for bit 15, which is clocked
   into the WAIT flip-flop.  This bit must be set for commands that return
   parameters (Request Status, Request Sector Address, Request Syndrome, and
   Request Disc Address) to hold off the controller until the channel has
   executed a Read I/O order.  Setting WAIT asserts DTRDY unconditionally; the
   controller will not send a word to the CPU until DTRDY denies, indicating
   that the interface data buffer is empty and ready to receive the word.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, the disc controller executes a status command, such as
       Request Status, by first asserting IFGTC to clear the command from the
       interface and then asserting IFIN to tell the interface that the (first)
       status word is ready for pickup.  Both IFGTC and IFIN assert CHANSR to
       the channel; the first completes the Control I/O order, and the second
       completes the TOGGLEINXFER phase of the Read I/O order.  Simulating this
       sequential assertion requires two calls to the controller.  The second
       call is placed the TOGGLEINXFER handler, although in hardware this signal
       has no effect on the controller state.

    2. In hardware, the PREADSTB and PWRITESTB signals each toggle the Data
       Ready flip-flop, rather than explicitly clearing and setting it,
       respectively.  The simulation maintains this action.

    3. In hardware, three serially connected End of Data flip-flops are
       employed.  The first presets on EOT, the second clocks on the leading
       edge of TOGGLEXFER, and the third clocks when the Data Ready flip-flop
       clears.  The output of the third drives the EOD line to the disc
       controller.  For a read, DTRDY denies when the trailing edge of PREADSTB
       clocks the third flip-flop.  For this to work, the implied relationship
       is EOT asserts before the leading edge of TOGGLEINXFER, which asserts
       before the trailing edge of PREADSTB.

       In simulation, PREADSTB is processed before EOT, which is processed
       before TOGGLEINXFER, which is the order of the leading edges of the
       hardware signals.  To simulate clocking the Data Ready flip-flop on the
       trailing edge, the action is performed in the TOGGLEINXFER handler
       instead of the PREADSTB handler.

    4. In hardware, the Device SR 1 flip-flop is cleared by assertion of the
       PCONTSTB or PWRITESTB signals, and the the Device SR 2 flip-flop is
       cleared by assertion of CHANSO without DEVEND or by the clear output of
       the SIO busy flip-flop.  Also, DEVEND forces CHANSR assertion.  In
       simulation, a unified device_sr flip-flop is employed that is cleared if
       CHANSO is asserted or SIO Busy is clear.

    5. When TOGGLESIOOK clears the sio_busy flip-flop, the controller must be
       called to poll the drives for attention.  Consider an SIO program that
       does a Seek on drive 0, followed by a Read on drive 1, followed by an
       End.  If the seek completes during the read, the Drive Attention
       interrupt won't occur after the End unless the drive is polled from the
       TOGGLESIOOK handler, as INTOK isn't asserted until the channel program
       ends.

    6. Receipt of a DRESETINT signal clears the interrupt request and active
       flip-flops but does not cancel a request pending but not yet serviced by
       the IOP.  However, when the IOP does service the request by asserting
       INTPOLLIN, the interface routine returns INTPOLLOUT, which will cancel
       the request.

   supports up to eight CPU interfaces simultaneously, and provision is made to
   poll each interface in turn via select and disconnect functions.  An
   interface only responds if it is currently selected.

   In simulation, a call to the dl_controller routine informs the controller of
   a (potential) change in flag state.  The current set of flags and data bus
   value are supplied, and the controller returns a combined set of functions
   and a data bus value.

   The controller must be called any time there is a change in the state of the
   interface or the drive units.  Generally, the cases that require notification
   are when the interface:

     - has a new command to execute
     - has a new data word available to send
     - has obtained the last data word received
     - has received a unit service event notification
     - has detected insertion or removal of a disc pack from a drive
     - has detected loading or unloading of a drive's heads
     - wants to hard-clear the controller

   The set of returned functions is processed sequentially, updating the
   interface state as indicated.  Some functions are not used by this interface,
   so they are masked off before processing to improve performance.

   Disc commands may be "stacked" on the interface by asserting PCONTSTB to
   store the new command into the data buffer register while the controller is
   still busy with the previous command.  This will assert CMRDY (if not in test
   mode), but the controller will not react to this signal until it finishes the
   current command.  For example, a channel program containing the Wakeup and
   End commands will transmit the End before the Wakeup completes.  This occurs
   because Wakeup asserts IFGTC to clear the command (and thereby asserts CHANSR
   to allow the channel to continue) about 18 microseconds before the controller
   completes the command and returns to the wait loop.  In simulation, an
   explicit check is made when a command completes.  If a stacked command is
   seen, the controller is called again to start it.

   Because the disc is a synchronous device, overrun or underrun can occur if
   the interface is not ready when the controller must transfer data.  There are
   four conditions that lead to an overrun or underrun:

    1. The controller is ready with a disc read word (IFCLK * IFIN), but the
       interface buffer is full (DTRDY).

    2. The controller needs a disc write word (IFCLK * IFOUT), but the interface
       buffer is empty (~DTRDY).

    3. The CPU attempts to read a word, but the interface buffer is empty
       (~DTRDY).

    4. The CPU attempts to write a word, but the interface buffer is full
       (DTRDY).

   The hardware design of the interface prevents the last two conditions, as the
   interface will assert CHANSR only when the buffer is full (read) or empty
   (write).  The interface does detect the first two conditions and sets the
   data overrun flip-flop if either occurs.

   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, OVRUN will be asserted when the controller requests write
       data when the buffer is empty.  In simulation, OVRUN will not be asserted
       when the controller is called with the empty buffer; instead, it will be
       asserted for the next controller call.  Because the controller will be
       called for the intersector phase, and because OVRUN isn't checked until
       that point, this "late" assertion does not affect overrun detection.

    2. In hardware, the data ready flip-flop is toggled as a result of reading
       or writing a word from or to the controller.  We follow that practice
       here, rather than setting or clearing it, which would be more
       appropriate.

    3. The hardware interface decodes the DSCIF and SELIF functions to allow the
       controller to be shared by two or more CPUs.  In simulation, these
       functions are ignored, as the simulator supports only one CPU connected
       to the interface.
