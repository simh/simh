   The HP 30135A System Clock/Fault Logging Interface is used with Series II and
   III systems and provides two devices on a single I/O card: a programmable
   interval clock employed as the MPE system clock and an interface to the ECC
   fault logging RAMs on the semiconductor main memory arrays.  This replaced
   the earlier 30031A System Clock/Console Interface that had been used with the
   CX and Series I machines, which used core memory.  As part of this change,
   the system console moved from the dedicated card to ATC port 0.

   The clock provides programmable periods of 10 microseconds to 10 seconds in
   decade increments.  Each "tick" of the clock increments a presettable counter
   that may be compared to a selected limit value.  The clock may request an
   interrupt when the values are equal, and a status indication is provided if
   the counter reaches the limit a second time without acknowledgement.

   The clock simulation provides both a REALTIME mode that establishes periods
   in terms of event intervals, based on an average instruction time of 2.5
   microseconds, and a CALTIME mode that calibrates the time delays to match
   wall-clock time.  As an example, in the former mode, a 1 millisecond period
   will elapse after 400 instructions are executed, whereas in the latter mode,
   the same period will elapse after 1 millisecond of wall-clock time.  As the
   simulator is generally one or two orders of magnitude faster than a real HP
   3000, the real-time mode will satisfy the expectations of software that times
   external events, such as a disc seek, via a delay loop, whereas the
   calibrated mode will update a time-of-day clock as expected by users of the
   system.  In practice, this means that setting REALTIME mode is necessary to
   satisfy the hardware diagnostics, and setting CALTIME mode is necessary when
   running MPE.

   Currently, the Fault Logging Interface simulator is not implemented.  This
   interface is accessed via DRT 2 by the MPE memory logging process, MEMLOGP,
   but the process is smart enough to terminate if DRT 2 does not respond.  As
   the simulator relies on a host memory array to simulate RAM and does not
   simulate the ECC check bits, an FLI implementation would always return a "no
   errors detected" condition.


   The clock interface responds only to direct I/O instructions, as follows:

   Control Word Format (CIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | M / rate  | E | - | irq reset | C | L | A | -   -   -   - | I |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     M = master reset (if bit 3 = 0)
     E = master reset enable/load count rate (0/1)
     C = reset count register after LR=CR interrupt
     L = a WIO addresses the limit/count (0/1) register
     A = reset all interrupts
     I = enable clock interrupts

   Count Rate Selection:

     000 = unused
     001 = 10 microseconds
     010 = 100 microseconds
     011 = 1 millisecond
     100 = 10 milliseconds
     101 = 100 milliseconds
     110 = 1 second
     111 = 10 seconds

   IRQ Reset:

     000 = none
     001 = clear LR = CR interrupt
     010 = clear LR = CR overflow interrupt
     011 = clear I/O system interrupt (SIN)
     100 = unused
     101 = unused
     110 = unused
     111 = unused


   Status Word Format (TIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | S | D |   rate    | -   -   -   -   - | C | F | - | I | L | R |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     S = SIO OK (always 0)
     D = direct read/write I/O OK (always 1)
     C = limit register = count register
     F = limit register = count register overflow (lost tick)
     I = I/O system interrupt request (SIN)
     L = limit/count (0/1) register selected
     R = reset count register after interrupt


   Output Data Word Format (WIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |           limit register value/count register reset           |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   If control word bit 9 is 0, the value is written to the limit register.  If
   control word bit 9 is 1, the count register is cleared to zero; the output
   value is ignored.


   Input Data Word Format (RIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                     count register value                      |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


   Implementation notes:

    1. MPE sets the system clock to a 1 millisecond period and a 100 millisecond
       limit to achieve the 10 interrupts per second rate required by the
       time-of-day clock maintained by the OS.  The short period precludes
       idling.  Therefore, this configuration is detected and implemented
       internally as a 10 millisecond service time with the counter incremented
       by 10 for each event service.  In addition, the clock service is
       synchronized with the CPU process clock service and the ATC poll service
       to improve idling.

    2. If the clock is calibrated, a prescaler is used to achieve the 1 second
       and 10 second periods while the event service time remains at 100
       milliseconds.  For periods shorter than 1 second, and for all realtime
       periods, the prescaler is not used.  The prescaler is necessary because
       the "sim_rtcn_calb" routine in the sim_timer library requires an integer
       ticks-per-second parameter.

   postlude, so that the counter will have the correct value if it's examined

/* System clock interface.

   The system clock is installed on the IOP bus and receives direct I/O commands
   from the IOP.  It does not respond to Programmed I/O (SIO) commands.

   In simulation, the asserted signals on the bus are represented as bits in the
   inbound_signals set.  Each signal is processed sequentially in numerical
   order, and a set of similar outbound_signals is assembled and returned to the
   caller, simulating assertion of the corresponding bus signals.

   There is no interrupt mask; interrupts are always unmasked, and the interface
   does not respond to the SMSK I/O order.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, setting the tick rate in the control word addresses a
       multiplexer that selects one of the 10 MHz clock division counter outputs
       as the clock source for the count register.  Setting the rate bits to 0
       inhibits the count register, although the division counter continues to
       run.  In simulation, setting a new rate stops and then restarts the event
       service with the new delay time, equivalent in hardware to clearing the
       clock division counter.

    2. Receipt of a DRESETINT signal clears the interrupt request and active
       flip-flops but does not cancel a request that is pending but not yet
       serviced by the IOP.  However, when the IOP does service the request by
       asserting INTPOLLIN, the interface routine returns INTPOLLOUT, which will
       cancel the request.

    3. The "%.0s" print specification in the DCONTSTB trace call absorbs the
       rate name parameter without printing when the rate is not specified.

   At each "tick" of the clock, the count register is incremented and compared
   to the limit register.  If they are equal, then the counter is cleared (if
   enabled) and an interrupt is generated (if enabled).

   If the clock is calibrated, a prescaler is used to achieve the 1 second and
   10 second periods while the event time remains at 100 milliseconds.  For
   periods shorter than 1 second, and for all realtime periods, the prescaler is
   not used (by setting the value to 1).

   If the clock is currently coscheduled with the CPU process clock, then the
   service interval is actually ten times the programmed rate, so the count
   register increment per service entry is 10 instead of 1.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The count/limit comparison hardware provides only an equal condition.  If
       the limit register is set to a value below the current count, or the
       LR=CR interrupt is not enabled until after the count register value has
       exceeded the limit, comparison will not occur until the count register
       overflows and again reaches the limit.

   This routine is called for a RESET or RESET CLK command.  It is the
   simulation equivalent of the IORESET signal, which is asserted by the front
   panel LOAD and DUMP switches.

   For this interface, IORESET is identical to a Programmed Master Reset
   (control word bit 0 set with bit 3 clear).

   A master reset is generated either by an IORESET signal or a Direct I/O
   Master Reset (control word bit 0 set with bit 3 clear).


   Implementation notes:

    1. In simulation, the Enable Clock Interrupts flip-flop, the Reset Count
       Register after LR=CR Interrupt flip-flop, and the Address Limit/Count
       Register flip-flop are maintained in the control word rather than as
       separate values.

    2. The hardware interrupt circuitry contains an Interrupt Active flip-flop
       and an Interrupt Priority latch but no Interrupt Request flip-flop.
       Instead, the INTREQ signal is the logical OR of the LR=CR Interrupt and
       LR=CR Overflow Interrupt flip-flops (if enabled by the Enable Clock
       Interrupts flip-flop) with the the System Interrupt flip-flop.  In
       simulation, the interrupt_request flip-flop in the Device Information
       Block is set explicitly to reflect this logic.  Clearing the three
       interrupt source flip-flops therefore clears the interrupt_request
       flip-flop as well.

   3.  In simulation, the clock division counters are represented by the event
       service delay.  Stopping and restarting the delay is equivalent to
       clearing the division counters.
