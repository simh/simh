   The HP 3000 is a family of general-purpose business computers that were sold
   by Hewlett-Packard from 1972 through 2001.  There are two major divisions
   within this family: the "classic" 16-bit, stack-oriented CISC machines, and
   the "Precision Architecture" 32-bit, register-oriented RISC machines that
   succeeded them.  All machines run versions of MPE, the "Multiprogramming
   Executive" operating system.

   Within the "classic" division, there are two additional subdivisions, based
   on the method used for peripheral connections: the original "SIO" machines,
   and the later "HP-IB" machines.  The I/O interfacing hardware differs between
   the two types of machines, as do the privileged I/O machine instructions.
   The user instruction sets are identical, as are the register sets visible to
   the programmer.  The I/O drivers are different to account for the hardware
   differences, and therefore they run slightly different versions of MPE.

   This implementation is a simulator for the classic SIO machines.  This group
   consists of the 3000 CX, the Series I, Series II, and Series III; the last is
   simulated here.  The CX and Series I, which is a repackaged CX, are
   essentially subsets of the Series II/III -- a smaller instruction set,
   limited memory size, and lower-precision floating-point instructions.
   Simulation of these machines may be added in the future.  Future simulation
   of the HP-IB machines (the Series 30 through 70) is desirable, as the latest
   MPE versions run only on these machines, but documentation on the internals
   of the HP-IB hardware controllers is nonexistent.

   The CX and Series I support 64K 16-bit words of memory.  The Series II
   supports up to 256K, divided into four banks of 64K words each, and the
   Series III extends this to 1024K words using 16 banks.  Memory is divided
   into variable-length code and data segments, with the latter containing a
   program's global data area and stack.

   Memory protection is accomplished by checking program, data, and stack
   accesses against segment base and limit registers, which can be set only by
   MPE.  Bounds violations cause automatic hardware traps to a handler routine
   within MPE.  Some violations may be permitted; for example, a Stack Overflow
   trap may cause MPE to allocate a larger stack and then restart the
   interrupted instruction.  Almost all memory references are position-
   independent, so moving segments to accommodate expansion requires only
   resetting of the segment registers to point at the new locations.  Code
   segments are fully reentrant and shareable, and both code and data are
   virtual, as the hardware supports absent code and data segment traps.

   The classic 3000s are stack machines.  Most of the instructions operate on
   the value on the top of the stack (TOS) or on the TOS and the next-to-the-top
   of the stack (NOS).  To improve execution speed, the 3000 has a set of
   hardware registers that are accessed as the first four locations at the top
   of the stack, while the remainder of the stack locations reside in main
   memory.  A hardware register renamer provides fast stack pushes and pops
   without physically copying values between registers.

   In hardware, the stack registers are referenced internally as TR0-TR3 and
   externally as RA-RD.  An access to the RA (TOS) register is translated by the
   renamer to access TR0, TR1, etc. depending on which internal register is
   designated as the current top of the stack.  For example, assume that RA
   corresponds to TR0.  To push a new value onto the top of the stack, the
   renamer is adjusted so that RA corresponds to TR1, and the new value is
   stored there.  In this state, RB corresponds to TR0, the previous TOS (and
   current NOS) value.  Additional pushes rename RA as TR2 and then TR3, with RB
   being renamed to TR1 and then TR2, and similarly for RC and RD.  The number
   of valid TOS registers is given by the value in the SR register, and the
   first stack location in memory is given by the value in the SM register.
   Pops reverse the sequence: a pop with RA corresponding to TR3 renames RA to
   TR2, RB to TR1, etc.  When all four stack registers are in use, a push will
   copy the value in RD to the top of the memory stack (SM + 1) before the
   registers are renamed and the new value stored into RA.  Similarly, when all
   four stack registers are empty, a pop simply decrements the SM register,
   effectively deleting the top of the memory stack.

   Because of the renamer, the microcode can always use RA to refer to the top
   of the stack, regardless of which internal TR register is being used, and
   similarly for RB-RD.  Execution of each stack instruction begins with a
   preadjustment, if needed, that loads the TOS registers that will be used by
   the instruction from the top of the memory stack.  For example, if only RA
   contains a value (i.e., the SR register value is 1), the ADD instruction,
   which adds the values in RA and RB, will load RB with the value on the top of
   the memory stack, the SR count will be incremented, and the SM register will
   be decremented.  On the other hand, if both RA and RB contained values (SR >=
   2), then no preadjustment would be required before the ADD instruction
   microcode manipulated RA and RB.

   In simulation, the renamer is implemented by physically copying the values
   between registers, as this is much faster than mapping via array index
   values, as the hardware does.  A set of functions provides the support to
   implement the hardware stack operations:

     cpu_push       - empty the TOS register (SR++, caller stores into RA)
     cpu_pop        - delete the TOS register (SR--)
     cpu_queue_up   - move from memory to the lowest TOS register (SR++, SM--)
     cpu_queue_down - move from the lowest TOS register to memory (SR--, SM++)
     cpu_flush      - move all stack registers to memory (SR = 0 on return)
     cpu_adjust_sr  - queue up until the required SR count is reached
     cpu_mark_stack - write a stack marker to memory

   The renamer is described in US Patent 3,737,871 (Katzman, "Stack Register
   Renamer", June 1973).

   The MPE operating system is supported by special microcode features that
   perform code and data segment mapping, segment access bounds checking,
   privilege checking, etc.  The layout of certain in-memory tables is known to
   both the OS and the microcode and is used to validate execution of
   instructions.  For instance, every stack instruction is checked for a valid
   access within the stack segment boundaries, which are set up by the OS
   before program dispatch.  For this reason, the 3000 cannot be operated as a
   "bare" machine, because these tables would not have been initialized.
   Similarly, the "cold load" process by which the OS is loaded from storage
   media into memory is entirely in microcode, as machine instructions cannot be
   executed until the required tables are loaded into memory.

   This OS/microcode integration means that the microcode may detect conditions
   that make continued execution impossible.  An example would be a not-present
   segment fault for the segment containing the disc I/O driver.  If such a
   condition is detected, the CPU does a "system halt."  This fatal microcode
   error, distinct from a regular programmed halt, causes operation to cease
   until the CPU is reset.

   The CPU hardware includes a free-running 16-bit process clock that increments
   once per millisecond whenever a user program is executing.  MPE uses the
   process clock to charge CPU usage to programs, and thereby to users, groups,
   and accounts.  Instructions are provided to read (RCLK) and set (SCLK) the
   process clock.


   The data types supported by the instruction set are:

     - 8-bit unsigned byte
     - 16-bit unsigned integer ("logical" format)
     - 16-bit two's-complement integer
     - 32-bit two's-complement integer
     - 32-bit sign-magnitude floating point
     - 64-bit sign-magnitude floating point

   Multi-word values are stored in memory with the most-significant words in the
   lowest addresses.  The stack is organized in memory from lower to higher
   addresses, so a value on the stack has its least-significant word on the top
   of the stack.

   Machine instructions are initially decoded by a sub-opcode contained in the
   four highest bits, as follows (note that the HP 3000 numbers bits from
   left-to-right, i.e., bit 0 is the MSB and bit 15 is the LSB):

   Most instructions are defined by unique 16-bit codes that specify the
   operations, operands, addressing modes, shift counts, etc.  For each of these
   instructions, there is only one canonical form that encodes a given
   instruction (or instruction pair, in the case of stack instructions).  For
   example, the octal value 140003 is the only value that encodes the "BR P+3"
   instruction.

   There are also instruction codes that contain one or more bits designated as
   "reserved" in the Machine Instruction Set Reference Manual.  For some of
   these instructions, the reserved bits do not affect instruction decoding.
   Each instruction of this type has a defined canonical form -- typically with
   the reserved bits set to zero -- but will execute identically if one of the
   undefined forms is used.  For example, the "MOVE" instructions define bits
   12-13 as 00, but the bits are not decoded, so values of 01, 10, and 11 for
   these bits will result in identical execution.  Specifically, "MOVE 0" is
   encoded canonically as octal value 020020, but the undefined codes 020024,
   020030, and 020034 execute "MOVE 0" as well.

   For the rest of these instructions, the reserved bits are decoded and will
   affect the instruction interpretation.  An example of this is the "IXIT"
   instruction.  It also defines bits 12-13 as 00 (canonical encoding 020360),
   but in this case the bits must be 00 for the instruction to execute; any
   other value (e.g., undefined codes 020364, 020370, or 020374) executes as a
   "PCN" instruction, whose canonical encoding is 020362.

   Finally, some codes are not assigned to any instructions, or they are
   assigned to instructions that are supplied by optional firmware that is not
   present in the machine.  These instruction codes are designated as
   "unimplemented" and will cause Unimplemented Instruction traps if they are
   executed.  Examples are the stack operation code 072 in either the left-hand
   or right-hand position (i.e., instruction codes 0072xx and 00xx72), codes
   020410-020415 if the Extended Instruction Set firmware option is not
   installed, and codes 036000-036777.

   When the simulator examines the bit patterns of instructions to execute, each
   will fall into one of four categories:

    1. Defined (canonical) instruction encodings.

    2. Undefined (non-canonical) instruction encodings, where reserved fields
       are "don't care" bits (e.g., MOVE).

    3. Undefined (non-canonical) instruction encodings, where reserved fields
       are decoded (e.g., IXIT).

    4. Unimplemented instruction encodings (e.g., stack opcode 072 or EADD with
       no EIS installed).

   When examining memory or register values in instruction-mnemonic form, the
   names of the canonical instructions in category 1 are displayed in uppercase,
   as are the names of the non-canonical instructions in category 2.  The
   non-canonical instruction names in category 3 are displayed in lowercase.
   This is to indicate to the user that the instructions that will be executed
   may not be the ones expected from the decoding.  Instruction names in
   category 4 that correspond to supported firmware options are displayed in
   uppercase, regardless of whether or not the option is enabled.  Category 4
   encodings that do not correspond to instructions are displayed in octal.

   All of the base set instructions are one word in length.  Most of the
   firmware extension instructions occupy one word as well, although some are
   two words long.  If the first word of a two-word instruction is valid but the
   second is not, an Unimplemented Instruction trap will occur, with P pointing
   to the location after the second word.


   The simulator provides four stop conditions related to instruction execution
   that may be enabled with a SET CPU STOP=<stop> command:

     <stop>  Action
     ------  ------------------------------------
     LOOP    stop on an infinite loop
     PAUSE   stop on a PAUS instruction
     UNDEF   stop on an undefined instruction
     UNIMPL  stop on an unimplemented instruction

   If an enabled stop condition is detected, execution ceases with the
   instruction pending, and control returns to the SCP prompt.  When simulation
   stops, execution may be resumed in two ways.  If the cause of the stop has
   not been remedied and the stop has not been disabled, resuming execution with
   CONTINUE, STEP, GO, or RUN will cause the stop to occur again.  Alternately,
   specifying the "-B" switch with any of the preceding commands will resume
   execution while bypassing the stop for the current instruction.

   The LOOP option stops the simulator if it attempts to execute an instruction
   that enters an infinite loop (e.g., BR P+0).  The branch instructions TBA,
   TBX, BCC, BR, BCY, BNCY, BOV, and BNOV result in an infinite loop if the
   branch displacement is zero and the branch condition is true.  The remaining
   branch instructions cannot result in an infinite loop, as they all modify the
   CPU state and so eventually reach a point where they drop out of the loop.

   The PAUSE option stops the simulator if execution of a PAUS instruction is
   attempted.  This instruction normally suspends instruction fetching until an
   interrupt occurs.  Clearing the stop and resuming execution suspends the
   fetch/execute process until an external interrupt occurs.  Resuming with the
   stop bypassed continues execution with the instruction following the PAUS;
   this is the same action that occurs when pressing the HALT button and then
   the RUN button in hardware.

   The UNDEF option stops the simulator if execution of a non-canonical
   instruction from decoding category 3 (i.e., an instruction containing a
   decoded reserved bit pattern other than that defined in the Machine
   Instruction Set manual) is attempted.  The intent is to catch instructions
   containing reserved fields with values that change the meaning of those
   instructions.  Bypassing the stop will decode and execute the instruction in
   the same manner as the HP 3000 microcode.

   The UNIMPL option stops the simulator if execution of an instruction from
   decoding category 4 is attempted.  Bypassing the stop will cause an
   Unimplemented Instruction trap.  Instructions that depend on the presence of
   firmware options are implemented if the option is present and unimplemented
   if the option is absent.  For example, instruction code 020410 executes as
   the EADD instruction if the Extended Instruction Set is enabled but is
   unimplemented if the EIS is disabled.  It is displayed as EADD in either
   case.

   The instructions in category 2 whose non-canonical forms do not cause an
   UNDEF stop are:

   In hardware, the SED instruction works correctly only if opcodes 030040 and
   030041 are used.  Opcodes 030042-030057 also decode as SED, but the status
   register is set improperly (the I bit is cleared, bits 12-15 are rotated
   right twice and then ORed into the status register).  In simulation, opcodes
   030042-030057 work correctly but will cause an UNDEF simulation stop if
   enabled.


   The CPU simulator provides extensive tracing capabilities that may be enabled
   with the SET CONSOLE DEBUG=<filename> and SET CPU DEBUG=<trace> commands.
   The trace options that may be specified are:

     Trace  Action
     -----  ----------------------------------
     INSTR  trace instruction executions
     DATA   trace memory data accesses
     FETCH  trace memory instruction fetches
     REG    trace registers
     PSERV  trace process clock service events

   A section of an example trace is:

     >>CPU fetch: 00.010342  020320    instruction fetch
     >>CPU instr: 00.010341  000300  ZROX,NOP
     >>CPU   reg: 00.006500  000000    X 000000, M i t r o c CCG

     >>CPU fetch: 00.010347  020320    instruction fetch

   The INSTR option traces instruction executions.  Each instruction is printed
   before it is executed.  The two opcodes of a stack instruction are printed
   together before the left-hand opcode is executed.  If the right-hand opcode
   is not NOP, it is reprinted before execution, with dashes replacing the
   just-executed left-hand opcode.

   The DATA option traces reads from and writes to memory.  Each access is
   classified by the memory bank register that is paired with the specified
   offset; they are: dma, absolute, program, data, and stack.  DMA accesses
   derive their bank addresses from the banks specified in Set Bank I/O program
   orders.  Absolute accesses always use bank 0.  Program, data, and stack
   accesses use the bank addresses in the PBANK, DBANK, and SBANK registers,
   respectively.

   The FETCH option traces instruction fetches from memory.  These accesses are
   separated from those traced by the DATA option because fetches usually are of
   little interest except when debugging the fetch/execute sequence.  Because
   the HP 3000 has a two-stage pipeline, fetches load the NIR (Next Instruction
   Register) with the instruction after the instruction to be executed from the
   CIR (Current Instruction Register).

   The REG option traces register values.  Two sets of registers are printed.
   After executing each instruction, the currently active TOS registers, the
   index register, and the status register are printed.  After executing an
   instruction that may alter the base registers, the program, data, and stack
   segment base registers are printed.

   The OPND option traces operand values.  Some instructions that take memory
   and register operands that are difficult to decode from DATA or REG traces
   present the operand values in a higher-level format.  The memory bank and
   address values are always those of the operands.  The operand data and value
   presented are specific to the instruction; see the instruction executor
   comments for details.

   The PSERV option traces process clock event service entries.  Each trace
   reports whether or not the CPU was executing on the Interrupt Control Stack
   when the process clock ticked.  Execution on the ICS implies that the
   operating system is executing.  As the process clock ticks every millisecond,
   enabling PSERV tracing can quickly produce a large number of trace lines.

   The various trace formats are interpreted as follows:

     >>CPU pserv: Process clock service entered not on the ICS


   The process clock offers a user-selectable choice of calibrated or realistic
   timing.  Calibrated timing adjusts the clock to match actual elapsed time
   (i.e., wall-clock time).  Realistic timing bases the process-clock interval
   on machine instructions executed, using a mean instruction time of 2.5
   microseconds.  Running on a typical host platform, the simulator is one or
   two orders of magnitude faster than a real HP 3000, so the number of machine
   instructions executed for a given calibrated time interval will be
   correspondingly greater.  When the process clock is calibrated, the current
   simulation speed, expressed as a multiple of the speed of a real HP 3000
   Series III, may be obtained with the SHOW CPU SPEED command.  The speed
   reported will not be representative if the machine was executing a PAUS
   instruction when the simulator was stopped.

   When enabled by a SET CPU IDLE command, execution of a PAUS instruction will
   idle the simulator.  While idle, the simulator does not use any host system
   processor time.  Idle detection requires that the process clock and system
   clock be set to calibrated timing.  Idling is disabled by default.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Three timing sources in the simulator may be calibrated to wall-clock
       time.  These are the process clock, the system clock, and the ATC poll
       timer.  The process clock is always enabled and running, although the
       PCLK register only increments if the CPU is not executing on the ICS.
       The system clock and poll timer run continuously if their respective
       devices are enabled.  If the ATC is disabled, then the process clock
       takes over polling for the simulation console.

       The three sources must be synchronized to allow efficient simulator
       idling.  This is accomplished by designating the process clock as the
       master device, which calls the SCP timer calibration routines, and
       setting the system clock and ATC poll timer to the process clock wait.
       All three devices will then enter their respective service routines
       concurrently.

    2. In hardware, the process clock period is fixed at one millisecond, and
       the system clock period, while potentially variable, is set by MPE to one
       millisecond with an interrupt every 100 ticks.  These periods are too
       short to allow the simulator to idle, as the host OS clock resolution is
       typically also one millisecond.

       Therefore, the process and system clock simulators are scheduled with
       ten-millisecond service times, and the PCLK and counter registers are
       incremented by ten for each event service.  To present the correct values
       when the registers are read, the counts are incremented by amounts
       proportional to the fractions of the service intervals that have elapsed
       when the reads occur.

    3. In simulation, the TOS renamer is implemented by permanently assigning
       the register names RA-RD to TR [0]-TR [3], respectively, and copying the
       contents between registers to pop and push values.  An alternate
       implementation approach is to use a renaming register, RN, that tracks
       the correspondence between registers and array entries, and to assign the
       register names dynamically using modular indices, e.g., RA is TR [RN], RB
       is TR [(RN + 1) & 3], etc.  In lieu of copying, incrementing and
       decrementing RN is done to pop and push values.

       Both implementations were mocked up and timing measurements made.  The
       results were that copying values is much faster than mapping via array

/* Register list.

   The CPU register list exposes the machine registers for user inspection and

     - REG_A  permits any display
     - REG_B  permits binary display
     - REG_M  defaults to CPU instruction mnemonic display
     - REG_T  defaults to CPU status mnemonic display


 Implementation notes:

    1. All registers that reference variables of type HP_WORD must have the
       REG_FIT flag for proper access if HP_WORD is a 16-bit type.

    2. The CNTR register is set to the value of the SR register when the
       micromachine halts or pauses.  This allows the SR value to be accessed by
       the diagnostics.  The top-of-stack registers are flushed to main memory
       when the machine halts or pauses, which alters SR.

/* Execute CPU instructions.

   This is the instruction decode routine for the HP 3000.  It is called from
   the simulator control program to execute instructions in simulated memory,
   starting at the simulated program counter.  It runs until the status to be
   returned is set to a value other than SCPE_OK.

   On entry, P points to the instruction to execute, and the "sim_switches"
   global contains any command-line switches included with the run command.  On
   exit, P points at the next instruction to execute (or the current
   instruction, in the case of a simulator stop during a PAUS instruction or
   after the first of two stack operations).

   Execution is divided into four phases.

   First, the instruction prelude configures the simulation state to resume
   execution.  This involves verifying that system power is on and there are no
   device conflicts (e.g., two devices with the same device number),
   initializing the I/O processor and channels, and setting the RUN switch if no
   other front panel switches are pressed.  These actions accommodate
   reconfiguration of the I/O device settings and program counter while the
   simulator was stopped.  The prelude also responds to one command-line switch:
   if "-B" is specified, the current set of simulation stop conditions is
   bypassed for the first instruction executed.  This allows, e.g., a PAUS
   instruction to be bypassed or an unimplemented instruction trap to be taken.

   Second, the microcode abort mechanism is set up.  Microcode aborts utilize
   the "setjmp/longjmp" mechanism to transfer control out of the instruction
   executors without returning through the call stack.  This allows an
   instruction to be aborted part-way through execution when continuation is
   impossible, e.g., due to a memory access violation.  It corresponds to direct
   microcode jumps out of the execution sequence and to the appropriate trap
   handlers.

   Third, the instruction execution loop decodes instructions and calls the
   individual executors in turn until a condition occurs that prevents further
   execution.  Examples of such conditions includes execution of a HALT
   instruction, a user stop request (CTRL+E) from the simulation console, a
   recoverable device error (such as an improperly formatted tape image), a
   user-specified breakpoint, and a simulation stop condition (such as execution
   of an unimplemented instruction).  The execution loop also polls for I/O
   events and device interrupts, and runs I/O channel cycles.  During
   instruction execution, the CIR register contains the currently executing
   instruction, the NIR register contains the next instruction to execute, and
   the P register points to the memory location two instructions ahead of the
   current instruction.

   Fourth, the instruction postlude updates the simulation state in preparation
   for returning to the SCP command prompt.  Devices that maintain an internal
   state different from their external state, such as the CPU process clock, are
   updated so that their internal and external states are fully consistent.
   This ensures that the state visible to the user during the simulation stop is
   correct.  It also ensures that the program counter points correctly at the
   next instruction to execute upon resumption.

   If enabled, the simulator is idled when a PAUS instruction has been executed
   and no service requests for the multiplexer or selector channels are active.
   Execution of a PAUS instruction suspends the fetch-and-execute process until
   an interrupt occurs or the simulator is stopped and then resumed with a GO -B
   or RUN -B command.

   The HP 3000 is a microcoded machine.  In hardware, the micromachine is always
   executing microinstructions, even when the CPU is "halted."  The halt/run
   state is simply a flip-flop setting, reflected in bit 15 of the CPX2
   register and the RUN light on the front panel, that determines whether the
   "halt-mode" or "run-mode" microprogram is currently executing.

   In simulation, the "cpu_micro_state" variable indicates the state of the
   micromachine, i.e., which section of the microcode it is executing, while
   CPX2 bit 15 indicates whether the macromachine is halted or running.  The
   micromachine may be in one of four states:

     - running : the run-mode fetch-and-execute microcode is executing
     - paused  : the run-mode PAUS instruction microcode is executing
     - waiting : the halt-mode cold load or dump microcode is executing
     - halted  : the halt-mode front panel microcode is executing

   Simulation provides a variety of stop conditions that break instruction
   execution and return to the SCP prompt with the CPU still in run mode.  These
   have no analog in hardware; the only way to stop the CPU is to press the HALT
   button on the front panel, which shifts the micromachine into halt-mode
   microcode execution.  When any of these conditions occur, the micromachine
   state is set to "halted," but the CPX2 run flag is remains set unless the
   stop was caused by execution of a HALT instruction.  Resuming execution with
   a STEP, CONT, GO, or RUN command proceeds as though the hardware RUN switch
   was pressed after a programmed halt.  This provides the proper semantics for
   seamlessly stopping and restarting instruction execution.

   A microcode abort is performed by executing a "longjmp" to the abort handler,
   which is outside of and precedes the instruction execution loop.  The value
   passed to "longjmp" is a 32-bit integer containing the Segment Transfer Table
   index of the trap handler in the lower word and an optional parameter in the
   upper word.  Aborts are invoked by the MICRO_ABORT macro, which takes as its
   parameter a trap classification value, e.g.:

     MICRO_ABORT (trap_Privilege_Violation);
     MICRO_ABORT (trap_Integer_Zero_Divide);

   Some aborts require an additional parameter and must be invoked by the
   MICRO_ABORTP macro, which takes a trap classification value and a
   trap-specific value as parameters.  The traps that require additional
   parameters are:

     MICRO_ABORTP (trap_CST_Violation, segment_number);
     MICRO_ABORTP (trap_STT_Violation, segment_number);
     MICRO_ABORTP (trap_CS_Absent,     label/n/0);
     MICRO_ABORTP (trap_DS_Absent,     DST_number);
     MICRO_ABORTP (trap_Uncallable,    label);
     MICRO_ABORTP (trap_Trace,         label/n/0);
     MICRO_ABORTP (trap_User,          trap_number);

   trap_User is not usually called explicitly via MICRO_ABORTP; rather,
   MICRO_ABORT is used with one of the specific user-trap identifiers, e.g.,
   trap_Integer_Overflow, trap_Float_Overflow, trap_Decimal_Overflow, etc., that
   supplies both the trap classification and the trap parameter value.

   In addition, user traps must be enabled by setting the T-bit in the status
   word.  If the T bit is not set, a user trap sets the O-bit (overflow) in the
   status word and resumes execution with the next instruction instead of
   invoking the user trap handler.

   When an abort occurs, an equivalent PCAL to the appropriate STT entry is set
   up.  Then execution drops into the instruction loop to execute the first
   instruction of the trap handler.

   When the instruction loop is exited, the CPU process clock and system clock
   registers are updated, the micromachine is halted, and control returns to
   SCP.  Upon return, P points at the next instruction to execute, i.e., the
   instruction that will execute when the instruction loop is reentered.

   If the micromachine is paused, then P is reset to point to the PAUS
   instruction, which will be reexecuted when the routine is reentered.  If it
   is running, then P is reset to point to the current instruction if the stop
   allows it to be rerun, or at the next instruction.


   Implementation notes:

    1. While the Microsoft VC++ "setjmp" documentation says, "All variables
       (except register variables) accessible to the routine receiving control
       contain the values they had when longjmp was called," the ISO C99
       standard says, "All accessible objects have values...as of the time the
       longjmp function was called, except that the values of objects of
       automatic storage duration that are local to the function containing the
       invocation of the corresponding setjmp macro that do not have
       volatile-qualified type and have been changed between the setjmp
       invocation and longjmp call are indeterminate."

       Therefore, after a microcode abort, we cannot depend upon the values of
       any local variables.

    2. In hardware, the NEXT microcode order present at the end of each
       instruction transfers the NIR content to the CIR, reads the memory word
       at P into the NIR, and increments P.  However, if an interrupt is
       present, then this action is omitted, and a microcode jump is performed
       to control store location 3, which then jumps to the microcoded interrupt
       handler.  In simulation, the CIR/NIR/P update is performed before the
       next instruction is executed, rather than after the last instruction
       completes, so that interrupts are handled before updating.

       In addition, the NEXT action is modified in hardware if the NIR contains
       a stack instruction with a non-NOP B stackop.  In this case, NEXT
       transfers the NIR content to the CIR, reads the memory word at P into the
       NIR, but does not increment P.  Instead, the R bit of the status register
       is set to indicate that a B stackop is pending.  When the NEXT at the
       completion of the A stackop is executed, the NIR and CIR are untouched,
       but P is incremented, and the R bit is cleared.  This ensures that if an
       interrupt or trap occurs between the stackops, P will point correctly at
       the next instruction to be executed.

       In simulation, following the hardware would require testing the NIR for a
       non-NOP B stackop at every pass through the instruction execution loop.
       To avoid this, the NEXT simulation unilaterally increments P, rather than
       only when a B stackop is not present, and the stack instruction executor
       tests for the B stackop and sets the R bit there.  However, by that time,
       P has already been incremented, so we decrement it there to return it to
       the correct value.

    3. The System Halt trap has no handler.  Instead, the simulator is halted,
       and control returns to the SCP prompt.

    4. The trace display for a trap reports the parameter value supplied with
       the microcode abort.  This is not necessarily the same as the parameter
       that is pushed on the stack for the trap handler.  As some traps, e.g.,
       trap_CST_Violation, can cause a System Halt, the placement of the trace
       call is dictated by the desire to report both the original trap and the
       System Halt trap, even though the placement results in the display of the
       incoming parameter value, rather than the stacked parameter value.

    5. The execution trace (DEB_EXEC) match test is performed in two parts to
       display the register values both before and after the instruction
       execution.  Consequently, the enable test is done before the register
       trace, and the disable test is done after.

    6. The execution test (exec_test) is set FALSE even though execution tracing
       is not specified.  This is done solely to reassure the compiler that the
       value is not clobbered by a longjmp call.

    7. The set of debug trace flags is restored in the postlude (and therefore
       also saved in the instruction prelude) to ensure that a simulation stop
       that occurs while an execution trace is in progress does not exit with
       the flags set improperly.

   This command processing routine implements the cold load and cold dump
   commands.  The syntax is:

     LOAD { <control/devno> }
     DUMP { <control/devno> }

   The <control/devno> is a number that is deposited into the SWCH register
   before invoking the CPU cold load or cold dump facility.  The CPU radix is
   used to interpret the number; it defaults to octal.  If the number is
   omitted, the SWCH register value is not altered before loading or dumping.

   On entry, the "arg" parameter is "Cold_Load" for a LOAD command and
   "Cold_Dump" for a DUMP command, and "buf" points at the remainder of the
   command line.  If characters exist on the command line, they are parsed,
   converted to a numeric value, and stored in the SWCH register.  Then the
   CPU's cold load/dump routine is called to set up the CPU state.  Finally, the
   CPU is started to begin the requested action.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The RUN command uses the RU_CONT argument instead of RU_RUN so that the
       run_cmd SCP routine will not reset all devices before entering the
       instruction executor.  The halt mode interrupt handlers for cold load and
       cold dump reset the simulator as appropriate for their commands (i.e.,
       the CPU and all I/O devices, or just the I/O devices, respectively).

/* Execute the POWER commands.

   This command processing routine is called to initiate a power failure or
   power restoration.  The "cptr" parameter points to the power option keyword;
   the "arg" parameter is not used.

   The routine processes commands of the form:

     POWER { FAIL | OFF | DOWN }
     POWER { RESTORE | ON | UP }

   In simulation, the "cpu_power_state" global variable indicates the current
   state of system power.  The simulator starts in the power_on state.  The
   POWER FAIL command moves from the power_on to the power_failing state if the
   CPU is running, or to the power_off state if it is not.  Execution of a HALT
   in the power_failing state moves to the power_off state.  The POWER RESTORE
   command moves from the power_off to the power_returning state if the CPU is
   running, or to the power_on state if it is not.  Execution of the power-on
   trap moves from the power_returning to the power_on state.

   The POWER FAIL and POWER RESTORE commands are only valid in the power_on and
   power_off states, respectively; otherwise, they print "Command not allowed."

   The four enumeration values model the states of the PON (power on) and PFW
   (power-fail warning) hardware signals, as follows:

     PON  PFW  State            Simulator Action
     ---  ---  ---------------  ----------------------------
      1    0   power on         executing normally
      1    1   power failing    executing with cpx1_PFINTR
      0    1   power off        will not execute
      0    0   power returning  executing with trap_Power_On

   In microcode, the power-fail routine writes the current value of the CPX2
   register to the word following the last word of the ICS.  This value is used
   by the power-on routine to decide if the CPU was running (cpx2_RUN bit is
   set) or halted at the time of the power failure.  A power failure is
   indicated by setting the cpx1_PFINTR bit in the CPX1 register; this causes an
   interrupt to the power-failure routine in the operating system, which
   performs an orderly shutdown followed by a programmed HALT to wait for power
   to die.  When power is restored, the power-on trap (trap_Power_On) is set up,
   and then, if the PF/ARS switch is in the "enable" position, the trap is
   taken, which restarts the operating system and any I/O that was in progress
   when power failed.  If the switch is in the "disable" position, the CPU
   remains halted, and the trap is taken when the RUN button is pressed.

   The POWER commands are entered at the SCP prompt.  If the machine was running
   at the time of power failure, execution is resumed automatically to execute
   the power-fail or power-restore OS routines.  If the machine was halted when
   the POWER commands were entered, the machine remains halted -- just the power
   state changes.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, when the power fail interrupt is serviced, the microcode
       sets the PWR INH flip-flop, which locks out the RUN switch and inhibits
       all other halt-mode (CPX2) and run-mode (CPX1) interrupts until the CPU
       is reset.  This ensures that the software power-fail interrupt handler
       executes unimpeded.  In simulation, a POWER FAIL command with the CPU
       running sets the power-fail interrupt bit in the CPX1 register and
       resumes execution in the power_on state.  When the interrupt is detected
       by the "cpu_run_mode_interrupt" routine, the state is changed to
       power_failing.  In this state, run-mode interrupts are not recognized.
       Halt-mode interrupts need no special handling, as the power state is
       changed to power_off when the CPU halts.  Therefore, the CPU is never in
       a "halted-and-waiting-for-power-to-fade-away" state.

    2. The RUN command uses the RU_CONT argument instead of RU_RUN so that the
       run_cmd SCP routine will not reset all devices before entering the
       instruction executor.  The halt-mode interrupt handlers for cold load and
       cold dump reset the simulator as appropriate for their commands (i.e.,
       the CPU and all I/O devices, or just the I/O devices, respectively).

    3. In order to set up the power-on trap, this routine presses the RUN button
       and continues the simulation.  After the trap is set up in the
       "sim_instr" routine, the halt-mode interrupt handler checks the PF/ARS
       switch and stops simulation if auto-restart is disabled.

/* Process a run-mode interrupt.

   This routine is called when one or more of the interrupt request bits are set
   in the CPX1 register.  The highest-priority request is identified and
   cleared, the interrupt classification and parameter are established, and the
   associated interrupt handler is set up for execution.  On return, the CPU has
   been configured and is ready to execute the first instruction in the handler.

   On entry, the routine first checks for an external interrupt alone; this is
   done to improve performance, as this is the most common case.  If some other
   interrupt is requested, or if multiple interrupts are requested, the CPX1
   register is scanned from MSB to LSB to identify the request.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, halting the CPU while a PAUS instruction is executing leaves
       P pointing to the following instruction, which is executed when the RUN
       button is pressed.  In simulation, this action occurs only when execution
       is resumed with the "-B" option to bypass the pause.  Otherwise, resuming
       (or stepping) continues with the PAUS instruction.

       If an interrupt occurs while PAUS is executing, the interrupt handler
       will return to the instruction following the PAUS, as though HALT and RUN
       had been pressed.  This occurs because P normally points two instructions
       beyond the current instruction, so stacking the value P - 1 during the
       interrupt will return to the next instruction to be executed.  When
       resuming the PAUS instruction from a simulation stop with an interrupt
       pending, though, P is set so that P - 1 points to the PAUS instruction,
       which is (correctly) the next instruction to execute on resumption.
       Stacking the usual P - 1 value, therefore, will cause the interrupt
       handler to return to the PAUS instruction instead of to the instruction
       following, as would have occurred had a simulation stop not been
       involved.

       Therefore, this case is detected when a PAUS instruction is in the CIR
       but the micromachine state is "running" instead of "paused", and P is
       incremented so that the return will be to the instruction following PAUS.

   This routine implements the SRP1-SRP4 microcode subroutines that adjust the
   stack until the prescribed number (1-4) of TOS registers are occupied.  It
   performs queue ups, i.e., moves values from the top of the memory stack to
   the bottom of the register file, until the specified SR value is reached.
   Stack underflow is checked after the all of the values have been moved.  The
   routine assumes that at least one value must be moved.


   Implementation notes:

    1. SR must be greater than 0 on entry, so that TR [SR - 1] is the last TOS
       register in use.

    2. SM and SR must not be modified within the call to cpu_read_memory.  For
       example, SR++ cannot be passed as a parameter.

    3. The cpu_queue_up routine isn't used, as that routine checks for a stack
       underflow after each word is moved rather than only after the last word.

/* Calculate an effective memory address.

   This routine calculates the effective address for a memory reference or
   branch instruction.  On entry, "mode_disp" contains the mode, displacement,
   index, and indirect fields of the instruction, "classification" and "offset"
   point to variables to receive the corresponding values, and "selector" points
   to a variable to receive the byte selection ("upper" or "lower") for byte-
   addressable instructions or is NULL for word-addressable instructions.  On
   exit, "classification" is set to the memory access classification, "offset"
   is set to the address offset within the memory bank implied by the
   classification, and "selector" is set to indicate the byte referenced if the
   pointer is non-NULL.

   The mode and displacement fields of the instruction encode an address
   relative to one of the base registers P, DB, Q, or S, as follows:

       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15

   The displacement encoded in the instruction is an unsigned value that is
   added to or subtracted from the indicated base register.

   If the X and I fields are both 0, the addressing is direct.  If the X field
   is 1, the addressing is indexed.  If the I field is 1, the addressing is
   indirect.  If both fields are 1, the addressing is indirect indexed, with
   indirection performed before indexing.

   To improve execution speed in hardware, a preadder is implemented that sums
   the offset contained in certain bits of the CIR with the index register (if
   enabled).  The primary use is to save a microinstruction cycle during memory
   reference instructions, which must add a base register, the offset in the
   CIR, and potentially the X register (either directly or shifted left or right
   by one place for LDD/STD or LDB/STB, respectively).  The preadder also serves
   to hold other counts obtained from the CIR, e.g., shift counts, although in
   these cases, the addition function is not used.

   This routine simulates the preadder as part of the effective address
   calculation.  The calculations employed for word addressing are:

     Direct word addressing:
       ea = PBANK.(P + displacement)
       ea = DBANK.(DB + displacement)
       ea = SBANK.(Q,S + displacement)

     Direct indexed word addressing:
       ea = PBANK.(P + displacement + X)
       ea = DBANK.(DB + displacement + X)
       ea = SBANK.(Q,S + displacement + X)

     Indirect word addressing:
       ea = PBANK.(P + displacement + M [PBANK.(P + displacement)])
       ea = DBANK.(DB + M [DBANK.(DB + displacement)])
       ea = DBANK.(DB + M [SBANK.(Q,S + displacement)])

     Indirect indexed word addressing:
       ea = PBANK.(P + displacement + M [PBANK.(P + displacement)] + X)
       ea = DBANK.(DB + M [DBANK.(DB + displacement)] + X)
       ea = DBANK.(DB + M [SBANK.(Q,S + displacement)] + X)

   The indirect cell contains either a self-relative, P-relative address or a
   DB-relative address, even for S or Q-relative modes.  Indirect branches with
   DB/Q/S-relative mode are offsets from PB, not DB.

   The effective address calculations employed for byte addressing are:

     Direct byte addressing:
       ea = DBANK.(DB + displacement).byte [0]
       ea = SBANK.(Q,S + displacement).byte [0]

     Direct indexed byte addressing:
       ea = DBANK.(DB + displacement + X / 2).byte [X & 1]
       ea = SBANK.(Q,S + displacement + X / 2).byte [X & 1]

     Indirect byte addressing:
       ea,I = DBANK.(DB + M [DBANK.(DB + displacement)] / 2).byte [cell & 1]
       ea,I = DBANK.(DB + M [SBANK.(Q,S + displacement)] / 2).byte [cell & 1]

     Indirect indexed byte addressing:
       ea,I = DBANK.(DB + (M [DBANK.(DB + displacement)] + X) / 2).byte [cell + X & 1]
       ea,I = DBANK.(DB + (M [SBANK.(Q,S + displacement)] + X) / 2).byte [cell + X & 1]

   For all modes, the displacement is a word address, whereas the indirect cell
   and index register contain byte offsets.  For direct addressing, the byte
   selected is byte 0.  For all other modes, the byte selected is the byte at
   (offset & 1), where the offset is the index register value, the indirect cell
   value, or the sum of the two.

   Byte offsets into data segments present problems, in that negative offsets
   are permitted (to access the DL-to-DB area), but there are not enough bits to
   represent all locations unambiguously in the potential -32K to +32K word
   offset range.  Therefore, a byte offset with bit 0 = 1 can represent either a
   positive or negative word offset from DB, depending on the interpretation.
   The HP 3000 adopts the convention that if the address resulting from a
   positive-offset interpretation does not fall within the DL-to-S range, then
   32K is added to the address, effectively changing the interpretation from a
   positive to a negative offset.  If this new address does not fall within the
   DL-to-S range, a Bounds Violation trap occurs if the mode is non-privileged.

   The reinterpretation as a negative offset is performed only if the CPU is not
   in split-stack mode (where either DBANK is different from SBANK, or DB does
   not lie between DL and Z), as extra data segments do not permit negative-DB
   addressing.  Reinterpretation is also not used for code segments, as negative
   offsets from PB are not permitted.


   Implementation notes:

    1. On entry, the program counter points to the instruction following the
       next instruction (i.e., the NIR location + 1).  However, P-relative
       offsets are calculated from the current instruction (CIR location).
       Therefore, we decrement P by two before adding the offset.

       In hardware, P-relative addresses obtained from the preadder are offset
       from P + 1, whereas P-relative addresses obtained by summing with
       P-register values obtained directly from the S-Bus are offset from P + 2.
       This is because the P-register increment that occurs as part of a NEXT
       micro-order is coincident with the R-Bus and S-Bus register loads; both
       operations occur when the NXT+1 signal asserts.  Therefore, the microcode
       handling P-relative memory reference address resolution subtracts one to
       get the P value corresponding to the CIR, whereas branches on overflow,
       carry, etc. subtract two.

    2. If the mode is indirect, this routine handles bounds checks and TOS
       register accesses on the initial address.

    3. The System Reference Manual states that byte offsets are interpreted as
       negative if the effective address does not lie between DL and Z.
       However, the Series II microcode actually uses DL and S for the limits.

    4. This routine calculates the effective address for the memory address
       instructions.  These instructions always bounds-check their accesses, and
       data and stack accesses are mapped to the TOS registers if the effective
       address lies between SM and SM + SR within the stack bank.

   The supplied byte offset from DB or PB is converted to a memory address,

   not zero, the converted address is assumed to be the starting address of a
   block, and an ending address, based on the block length, is calculated and

   represent all locations unambiguously in the potential -32K to +32K word
   offset range.  Therefore, a byte offset with bit 0 = 1 can represent either a
   positive or negative word offset from DB, depending on the interpretation.
   The HP 3000 adopts the convention that if the address resulting from a
   positive-offset interpretation does not fall within the DL-to-S range, then
   32K is added to the address, effectively changing the interpretation from a
   positive to a negative offset.  If this new address does not fall within the
   DL-to-S range, a Bounds Violation trap occurs if the mode is non-privileged.

   The reinterpretation as a negative offset is performed only if the CPU is not
   in split-stack mode (where either DBANK is different from SBANK, or DB does
   not lie between DL and Z), as extra data segments do not permit negative-DB
   addressing.  Reinterpretation is also not used for code segments, as negative
   offsets from PB are not permitted.

/* Set up the entry into an interrupt handler.

   This routine prepares the CPU state to execute an interrupt handling
   procedure.  On entry, "class" is the classification of the current interrupt,
   and "parameter" is the parameter associated with the interrupt.  On exit, the
   stack has been set up correctly, and the PB, P, PL, and status registers have
   been set up for entry into the interrupt procedure.

   Run-mode interrupts are classified as external or internal and ICS or
   non-ICS.  External interrupts are those originating with the device
   controllers, and internal interrupts are conditions detected by the microcode
   (e.g., a bounds violation or arithmetic overflow).  ICS interrupts execute
   their handlers on the system's Interrupt Control Stack.  Non-ICS interrupts
   execute on the user's stack.

   Of the run-mode interrupts, the External, System Parity Error, Address
   Parity Error, Data Parity Error, and Module interrupts execute on the ICS.
   All other interrupts execute on the user's stack.  The routine begins by
   determining whether an ICS or non-ICS interrupt is indicated.  The
   appropriate stack is established, and the stack marker is written to preserve
   the state of the interrupted routine.  The label of the handler procedure is
   obtained, and then the procedure designated by the label is set up.  On
   return, the first instruction of the handler is ready to execute.


   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine implements various execution paths through the microcode
       labeled as INT0 through INT7.

    2. This routine is also called directly by the IXIT instruction executor if
       an external interrupt is pending.  This is handled as an external
       interrupt but is classified differently so that the teardown and rebuild
       of the stack may be avoided to improve performance.

/* Set up an interrupt on the Interrupt Control Stack.

   This routine prepares the Interrupt Control Stack (ICS) to support interrupt
   processing.  It is called from the run-time interrupt routine for ICS
   interrupts, the microcode abort routine for ICS traps, and from the DISP and
   PSEB instruction executors before entering the dispatcher.  On entry, "class"
   is the interrupt classification, and, if the class is "irq_Trap", then "trap"
   is the trap classification.  The trap classification is ignored for
   interrupts, including the dispatcher start interrupt.

   Unless entry is for a Cold Load trap, the routine begins by writing a
   six-word stack marker.  This special ICS marker extends the standard marker
   by adding the DBANK and DB values as follows:

       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15

     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                  PB-relative return address                   |  [Q - 2]  P + 1 - PB
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                     Status register value                     |  [Q - 1]  STA
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | D |                     Delta Q value                         |  [Q - 0]  S - Q
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                         DB-Bank value                         |  [Q + 1]  DBANK
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                           DB value                            |  [Q + 2]  DB
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     D = the dispatcher was interrupted

   After the values are written, the Q register is set to point to the marker.
   The stack bank register is then cleared, as the ICS is always located in
   memory bank 0.

   If the interrupt or trap occurred while executing on the ICS, and the
   dispatcher was running at the time, the "dispatcher running" bit in the CPX1
   register is cleared, and the D-bit is set in the delta-Q value word of the
   stack marker.  This bit will be used during interrupt exit to decide whether
   to restart the dispatcher.

   If the CPU was executing on the user's stack, the "ICS flag" bit in CPX1 is
   set, the Q register is reset to point at the permanent dispatcher stack
   marker established by the operating system, and the Z register is reset to
   the stack limit established by the OS for the ICS; the values are obtained
   from reserved memory locations 5 and 6, respectively.  The ICS DB value is
   read from the ICS global area that precedes the dispatcher stack marker and
   is used to write the stack-DB-relative S value back to the global area.

   Finally, the stack pointer is set to point just above the stack marker.

    1. This routine implements various execution paths through the microcode

/* Set up a code segment.

   This routine is called to set up a code segment in preparation for calling or
   exiting a procedure located in a segment different from the currently
   executing segment.  On entry, "label" indicates the segment number containing
   the procedure.  On exit, the new status register value and the first word of
   the Code Segment Table entry are returned to the variables pointed to by
   "status" and "entry_0", respectively.

   The routine begins by reading the CST pointer.  The CST is split into two
   parts: a base table, and an extension table.  The table to use is determined
   by the requested segment number.  Segment numbers 0 and 192, corresponding to
   the first entries of the two tables, are reserved and cause a CST Violation
   trap if specified.

   The CST entry corresponding to the segment number is examined to set the
   program bank, base, and limit registers (the segment length stored in the
   table is number of quad-words, which must be multiplied by four to get the
   size in words).  The new status register value is set up and returned, along
   with the first word of the CST entry.


   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine implements the microcode SSEG subroutine.

    2. Passing -1 as a parameter to trap_CST_Violation ensures that the segment
       number >= 2 check will pass and the trap handler will be invoked.

    3. The Series II microcode sets PBANK and PB unilaterally but sets PL only
       if the code segment is not absent.  An absent segment entry contains the
       disc address in words 3 and 4 instead of the bank address and base
       address, so PBANK and PB will contain invalid values in this case.  It is
       not clear why the microcode avoids setting PL; the microinstruction in
       question also sets Flag 2, so conditioning PL may be just a side effect.
       In any case, we duplicate the firmware behavior here.

    4. This routine is only used locally, but we leave it as a global entry to
       support future firmware extensions that may need to call it.

   "label" contains an external program label indicating the segment number and

   program label indicating the starting address of the procedure, and "offset"
   contains an offset to be added to the starting address.  On exit, the
   registers are set up for execution to resume with the first instruction of
   the procedure.

   If the label is a local label, the PB-relative address is obtained from the
   label and stored in the P register, and the Next Instruction Register is
   loaded with the first instruction of the procedure.

   If the label is external, the code segment referenced by the label is set up.
   If the "trace" or "absent" bits are set, the corresponding trap is taken.
   Otherwise, the Segment Transfer Table length is read, and the STT entry
   number is validated; if it references a location outside of the table, a STT
   violation trap is taken.

   Otherwise, the valid STT entry is examined.  If the target procedure is not
   in the designated code segment or is uncallable if not in privileged mode,
   the appropriate traps are taken.  If the STT entry contains a local label, it
   is used to set up the P register and NIR as above.

   The "offset" parameter is used only by the XBR instruction executor.  The

   execution at the first instruction of the designated procedure.

/* Return from a procedure.

   This routine sets up the P, Q, SM, and status registers to return from a
   procedure.  It is called by the EXIT and IXIT instruction executors and by
   the cpu_start_dispatcher routine to enter the dispatcher.  On entry, "new_q"
   and "new_sm" contain the new values for the Q and SM registers that unwind
   the stack.  The "parameter" value is used only if a Trace or Code Segment
   Absent trap is taken.  For EXIT, the parameter is the stack adjustment value
   (the N field).  For IXIT, the parameter is zero.  On exit, the registers are
   set up for execution to resume with the first instruction after the procedure
   call or interrupt.

   The routine begins by reloading register values from the stack marker.  The
   stack marker format is:

       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                       X register value                        |  [Q - 3]  X
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | T | M |          PB-relative return address                   |  [Q - 2]  P + 1 - PB
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                     Status register value                     |  [Q - 1]  STA
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                         Delta Q value                         |  [Q - 0]  S - Q
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     T = a trace or control-Y interrupt is pending
     M = the code segment is physically mapped

   The T and M bits are set by the operating system, if applicable, after the
   stack marker was originally written.

   Stack underflow and overflow are checked, and privilege changes are
   validated.  If the return will be to a different code segment, it is set up.
   Finally, the new P, Q, SM, and status register values are loaded, and NIR is
   loaded with the first instruction after the return.


   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine implements the microcode EXI1 subroutine.

    2. We pass a temporary status to cpu_setup_code_segment because it forms the
       returned new status from the current STA register value.  But for EXIT
       and IXIT, the new status comes from the stack marker, which already has
       the segment number to which we're returning, and which must not be
       altered.

    3. The NEXT action is modified when the R-bit is set in the status word
       being restored.  This occurs when an interrupt occurred between the two
       stackops of a stack instruction.  The main instruction loop does not
       alter CIR in this case, so we must set it up here.

/* Service the CPU process clock.

   The process clock is used by the operating system to time per-process CPU
   usage.  It is always enabled and running, although the PCLK register only
   increments if the CPU is not executing on the ICS.

   The process clock may be calibrated to wall-clock time or set to real time.
   In hardware, the process clock has a one-millisecond period.  Setting the
   mode to real time schedules clock events based on the number of event ticks
   equivalent to one millisecond.  Because the simulator is an order of
   magnitude faster than the hardware, this short period precludes idling.

   In the calibrated mode, the short period would still preclude idling.
   Therefore, in this mode, the clock is scheduled with a ten-millisecond
   service time, and the PCLK register is incremented by ten for each event
   service.  To present the correct value when PCLK is read, the
   "cpu_update_pclk" routine is called by the RCLK instruction executor to
   increment the count by an amount proportional to the fraction of the service
   interval that has elapsed.  In addition, that routine is called by the CPU
   instruction postlude, so that PCLK will have the correct value if it is
   examined from the SCP command prompt.

   The simulation console is normally hosted by, and therefore polled by, the
   ATC on channel 0.  If the console is not hosted by the ATC, due either to a
   SET ATC NOCONSOLE or a SET ATC DISABLED command, the process clock assumes
   polling control over the console.


   Implementation notes:

    1. If the process clock is calibrated, the system clock and ATC poll
       services are synchronized with the process clock service to improve
       idling.

    2. The current CPU speed, expressed as a multiple of the hardware speed, is
       calculated for each service entry.  It may be displayed at the SCP prompt
       with the SHOW CPU SPEED command.  The speed is only representative when
       the process clock is calibrated, and the CPU is not executing a PAUS
       instruction (which suspends the normal fetch/execute instruction cycle).

/* Process a halt-mode interrupt.

   This routine is called when one or more of the interrupt request bits are set
   in the CPX2 register.  These bits represent switch closures on the CPU front
   panel or on the optional maintenance display panel.  The specific switch
   closure is identified, and the corresponding microcode routine is executed.
   If multiple bits are set in CPX2, the microcode recognizes them in order from
   MSB to LSB.

   If the RUN switch is set, a test is made for a System Halt, which inhibits
   recognition of the switch.  If the System Halt flag is set, the CPU must be
   reset before execution may be resumed.  Otherwise, the NIR is reloaded in
   case P was changed during the simulation stop.  If the R-bit (right stack op
   pending) flag in the status register is set, but the NIR no longer contains a
   stack instruction, R is cleared.  If a stack instruction is present, and the
   R-bit is set, then the CIR is set, and the following instruction is fetched.
   The micromachine state is set to "running", and one event tick is added back
   to the accumulator to ensure that a single step won't complete without
   executing an instruction.

   If the DUMP switch is pressed, an I/O Reset is performed on all devices
   except the CPU, which is skipped to preserve the register state.  The dump
   device number is obtained from the SWCH register and tested to ensure that a
   tape is mounted with a write ring and the unit is online.  Then the contents
   of the CPU registers are written to the reserved memory area starting at
   address 1400 octal in bank 0.  This is followed by two SIO programs.  The
   main program at addresses 1430-1437 write 4K-word blocks of memory to the
   dump device.  The error recovery program at addresses 1422-1427 is invoked
   when a write fails.  It does a Backspace Record followed by a Write Gap to
   skip the bad spot on the tape, and then the write is retried.

   The DUMP switch remains set, so after each pass through the main execution
   loop to run a channel cycle, this routine is reentered.  The "waiting" state
   causes the second part of the process to check for device completion.  When
   it occurs, the expected external interrupt is cleared, and if the dump is
   complete, the DUMP switch is reset, the original SIO pointer in the DRT is
   restored, and the micromachine is halted.  Otherwise, the SIO pointer is
   read.  If it points at the end of the program, then the operation completed
   normally.  In this case, the dump address is advanced, and, if all of memory
   has been dumped, the SIO pointer is reset to the recovery program, and that
   program is changed to finish up with Write File Mark and Rewind/Offline
   commands.  Otherwise, the pointer is reset to the main program in preparation
   for the next 4K write.  The SIO program is then restarted.

   If SIO pointer failed to complete, the pointer is reset to point at the error
   recovery program, and the memory address is unchanged; the same 4K write will
   be performed once the recovery program runs.  If the recovery program fails,
   the dump is terminated at that point with a failure indication.

   During the dump operation, the CIR register is continually updated with the
   current memory bank number.  If the dump runs to completion, CIR will contain
   the number of 64K memory banks installed in the machine.  A value less than
   the installed memory value indicates a dump failure.  Except for the CIR, the
   machine state is restored, so that another dump may be attempted.

   If the LOAD switch is pressed, the cold load process begins by filling memory
   with HALT 10 instructions if SWCH register bit 8 is clear.  The cold load
   device number is obtained from the lower byte of the SWCH register.

   The first part of the cold load process clears the TOS and STA registers,
   stores the initial channel program in memory, and executes an SIO instruction
   to start the channel.  Once the device starts, interrupts are enabled, and
   the micromachine state is set to "waiting" in preparation for executing the
   second part of the cold load process once the channel program ends.  The
   routine then exits to begin channel execution.

   The LOAD switch remains set, so after each pass through the main execution
   loop to run a channel cycle, this routine is reentered.  The "waiting" state
   causes the second part of the process to check for device completion.  The
   expected external interrupt is cleared, the LOAD switch is cleared, the
   micromachine state is set to "running", and the Cold Load trap is taken to
   complete the process.


   Implementation notes:

    1. After RUN switch processing and return to the instruction loop, if no
       interrupt is present, and the R-bit in the status register is clear, then
       CIR will be set from NIR, and NIR will be reloaded.  If the R-bit is set,
       then CIR and NIR will not be changed, i.e., the NEXT action will be
       skipped, so we perform it here.  If an interrupt is pending, then the
       interrupt will be processed using the old value of the CIR, and the
       instruction in the NIR will become the first instruction executed after
       the interrupt handler completes.

    2. The cold load microcode is shared with the cold dump process.  The Series
       II dump process saves memory locations DRT + 0 through DRT + 3 in the TOS
       registers.  The load process uses the same microcode but does not perform
       the memory read, so the TOS registers are loaded with the previous
       contents of the OPND register, which is effectively a random value.  In
       simulation, the TOS registers are cleared.

    3. The cold load and dump microcode waits forever for an interrupt from the
       cold load device.  If it doesn't occur, the microcode hangs until a
       system reset is performed (it tests CPX1 bit 8 and does a JMP *-1 if the
       bit is not set).  The simulation follows the microcode behavior.

    4. Front panel diagnostics and direct I/O cold loading is not implemented.

   This routine executes the CPU instruction present in the CIR.  The CPU state
   (registers, memory, interrupt status) is modified as necessary, and the
   routine return SCPE_OK if the instruction executed successfully.  Any other
   status indicates that execution should cease, and control should return to
   the simulator console.  For example, a programmed HALT instruction returns
   STOP_HALT status.

   Unimplemented instructions are detected by those decoding branches that
   result from bit patterns not corresponding to legal instructions or
   corresponding to optional instructions not currently enabled.  Normally,
   execution of an unimplemented instruction would result in an Unimplemented
   Instruction trap.  However, for debugging purposes, a simulator stop may be
   requested instead by returning STOP_UNIMPL status if the SS_UNIMPL simulation
   stop flag is set.

   This routine implements the main instruction dispatcher, as well as memory
   address instructions (subopcodes 04-17).  Instructions corresponding to
   subopcodes 00-03 are executed by routines in the base instruction set module.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Each instruction executor begins with a comment listing the instruction
       mnemonic and, following in parentheses, the condition code setting, or
       "none" if the condition code is not altered, and a list of any traps that
       might be generated.

    2. Stack preadjusts are simpler if performed explicitly due to overlapping
       requirements that reduce the number of static preadjusts to 4 of the 16
       entries.

    3. The order of operations for each instruction follows the microcode.  For
       example, the LOAD instruction performs the bounds check on the effective
       address and reads the operand before pushing the stack down and storing
       it in the RA registrer.  Pushing the stack down first and then reading
       the value directly into the RA register would leave the stack in a
       different state if the memory access caused a Bounds Violation trap.

    4. The TBA, MTBA, TBX, and MTBX instructions take longer to execute than the
       nominal 2.5 microseconds assumed for the average instruction execution
       time.  Consequently, the 7905 disc diagnostic fails Step 66 (the retry
       counter test) if the DS device is set for REALTIME operation.  The
       diagnostic uses the MTBA P+0 instruction in a timing loop, which expires
       before the disc operations complete.

       A workaround for this diagnostic is to decrement sim_interval twice for
       these instructions.  However, doing so causes the 7970 tape diagnostic to
       fail Step 532 (the timing error test) for the opposite reason: a wait
       loop of MTBA P+0 instructions causes the tape data transfer service event
       time to count down twice as fast, while the multiplexer channel data
       transfer polls occur at the usual one per instruction.  This could be
       remedied by having the channel polls execute twice as many I/O cycles for
       these instructions, although the general solution would be to recast
       sim_intervals as microseconds and to decrement sim_interval by differing
       amounts appropriate for each instruction.
