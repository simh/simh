/* Operand types.

   Operand types indicate how to print or parse instruction mnemonics.  There is
   a separate operand type for each unique operand interpretation.  For
   printing, the operand type and associated operand mask indicate which bits
   form the operand value and what interpretation is to be imposed on that
   value.  For parsing, the operand type additionally implies the acceptable
   syntax for symbolic entry.

   Operand masks are used to isolate the operand value from the instruction
   word.  As provided, a logical AND removes the operand value; an AND with the
   complement leaves only the operand value.  The one-for-one correspondence
   between operand types and masks must be preserved when adding new operand
   types.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Immediate values, displacements, and decrements are assumed to be
       right-justified in the instruction word, i.e., extend from bits n-15,
       unless otherwise noted.

    2. Operands for one-word instructions are in the lower (first) word;
       operands for two-word instructions are in the upper (second) word.

    3. Operand masks for signed values must include both signs and magnitudes.

    4. Operand masks are defined as the complements of the operand bits to make
       it easier to see which bits will be cleared when the value is ANDed.  The
       complements are calculated at compile-time and so impose no run-time
       penalty.

    5. The base set "move" instructions contain S-decrement fields that indicate
       the counts of parameters to remove from the stack when the instructions
       complete.  Certain "decimal arithmetic" instructions of the optional
       Extended Instruction Set and certain "numeric conversion and load"
       instructions of the optional COBOL II Extended Instruction Set contain
       one or two S-decrement bits, but these encode the stack adjustment rather
       than expressing the adjustment directly.

       The SPL "ASMB" statement accepts the EIS instructions with the stack
       adjustment given as the encoded value, e.g., CVAD 0 and CVAD 1 are
       accepted, with the former deleting two words and the latter deleting four
       words from the stack.  Therefore, all S-decrement operands are printed
       and parsed as their direct field values, rather than decoding and
       encoding the actual decrements.

/* Instruction classifications.

   Machine instructions on the HP 3000 are identified by a varying number of
   bits.  In general, the four most-significant bits identify the general class
   of instruction, and additional bits form a sub-opcode within a class to
   identify an instruction uniquely.  However, some instructions are irregular
   or have reserved bits.  These bits are defined to be zero, but correct
   hardware decoding may or may not depend on the value being zero.

   Each instruction is classified by a mnemonic, a base operation code (without
   the operand), an operand type, and a mask for the reserved bits, if any.
   Classifications are grouped by class of instruction into arrays that are
   indexed by sub-opcodes, if applicable.

   An operation table consists of two parts, either of which is optional.  If a
   given class has a sub-opcode that fully or almost fully decodes the class,
   the first (primary) part of the table contains the appropriate number of
   classification elements.  This allows rapid access to a specific instruction
   based on its bit pattern.  In this primary part, the reserved bits masks are
   not defined or used.

   If some instructions in a class have reserved bits, if the sub-opcode
   decoding is not regular, or if the instruction requires two words to decode,
   then the second (secondary) part of the table contains classification
   elements that specify reserved bits masks.  This part is searched linearly.

   As an example, the stack instructions have bits 0-3 = 0.  The remaining
   twelve bits are broken into two six-bit fields.  Each field encodes one of 64
   stack operations (actually, 63 operations, as one is unassigned).  As the
   stack operations are fully decoded, the table consists only of 64 primary
   elements, corresponding one-for-one to the 64 operations.

   As as contrasting example, the shift and branch operations have bits 0-3 = 1
   and are fully decoded by bits 5-9, except for two instructions that have
   reserved bit fields (SCAN and TNSL), and two instructions that require one
   more bit for full decoding (QASL and QASR).  The table consists of a primary
   part of 32 elements and a secondary part of four elements.  The three primary
   elements corresponding to the four partially-decoded instructions are
   indicated by zero-length mnemonics.  The four secondary elements contain an
   entry for each instruction that requires additional masking before unique
   identification is possible.

   Some instructions contain reserved bits that may or may not affect hardware
   instruction decoding.  For example, the MOVE instruction defines bits 12-13
   as 00, but the bits are not decoded, so MOVE will result regardless of the
   values.  IXIT also defines bits 12-13 as 00, but in this case they must be 00
   for the instruction to execute; any other value executes a PCN instruction.

   For those instructions dependent on their reserved bits for interpretation,
   the operations table has two entries for each opcode.  The first entry
   specifies a reserved bits mask of all-ones; this entry matches the canonical
   opcode.  The second entry specifies a mask that matches the opcode to the
   range of opcodes that decode to the instruction; this entry presents the
   opcode mnemonic in lowercase as an indicator that it is not the canonical
   representation.

   Two-word instructions are, by definition, never decoded by a primary opcode,
   so they will always be found in the secondary entries of a classification
   table with 32-bit opcode and reserved bits mask values.  The opcode value
   contains the first word of the instruction in the lower half and the second
   word in the upper half.  The lower half of the reserved bits mask value will
   have all bits set, and the upper half will have all bits set except for those
   corresponding to reserved bits in the second instruction word (if any).  A
   two-word entry, therefore, may be identified by a mask value with a non-zero
   upper half.

   A secondary entry with a zero-length mnemonic may be used to match the first
   word of a two-word instruction if none of the second words match earlier
   entries.  This ensures that unimplemented two-word instructions are printed
   as a two-word octal value rather than as a one-word octal value followed by
   the mnemonic for a one-word instruction.

   The end of an operations table is indicated by a NULL mnemonic pointer.

   are not.  Therefore, it's easier to treat all of the instructions as

   The table consists of 16 primary entries for the immediate, bit field, and
   register instructions, followed by the secondary entries for the remaining
   instructions.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The IXIT, PCN, LOCK, and UNLK instructions specify bits 12-15 as
       0000-0011.  However, values other than zero in bits 12-13 will decode to
       one of these instructions.  Specifically, the value of bits 12-15 for
       IXIT = 0000, PCN = nnn0, LOCK = nn01, and UNLK = nn11, where n is any
       collective value other than 0.

    2. The secondary entry with the empty mnemonic ensures that an unimplemented
       two-word instruction is printed as "020477,000001" (e.g.) rather than
       "020477" followed by "NOP,DELB".

    3. By convention, SIMH simulators always decode all supported instructions,
       regardless of whether or not they are enabled by current CPU firmware
       configurations.  So the EIS, APL, and COBOL-II instructions are present
       in the table and are not conditional on the CPU options set.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The SED instruction specifies bits 12-14 as 000, and the instruction only
       works correctly if opcodes 030040 and 030041 are used.  Values other than
       000 will decode and execute as SED, but the status register is set
       improperly (the I bit is cleared, bits 12-15 are rotated right twice and
       then ORed into the status register).

    2. The XCHD, DISP, PSDB, and PSEB instructions specify bits 12-15 as
       0000-0011.  However, values other than zero in bits 12-13 will decode to
       one of these instructions.  Specifically, the value of bits 12-15 for
       XCHD = 0000, DISP = nnn0, PSDB = nn01, and PSEB = nn11, where n is any
       collective value other than 0.

    3. The SMSK, SCLK, RMSK, and RCLK instructions specify bits 12-15 as
       0000-0011.  However, values other than zero in bits 12-14 will decode to
       one of these instructions.  Specifically, the value of bits 12-15 for
       SMSK and RMSK = 0000, and SCLK and SMSK = nnnn, where n is any collective
       value other than 0.

    4. The double entries for DISP, SCLK, and RCLK ensure that their full ranges
       decode to the indicated instructions for printing but only the primary
       opcode is encoded when entering instructions in symbolic form.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The BCC instruction specifies the branch condition in bits 7-9.  There
       are separate secondary entries for each of the conditions.

    2. The BR (Branch) instruction has two forms.  When bit 6 = 0, it has a
       P-relative displacement with optional indexing and indirection.  When bit
       6 = 1, it has an indirect DB/Q/S-relative displacement with optional
       indexing.  Two secondary entries are needed for the two operand types.
       The opcode for BR DB/Q/S,I is 143000, i.e., with the I bit forced on.
       The second opcode entry is 141000 to put the I bit with the operand for
       proper decoding.

    3. Signed displacements are in sign-magnitude form, not two's complement.

/* EDIT subprogram operations.

   The EDIT instruction, part of the COBOL II Extended Instruction Set,
   implements the COBOL "PICTURE" clause.  The formation of the edited string is
   controlled by a subprogram whose address is pushed onto the stack.
   Subprogram operations are encoded into variable-length sequences of bytes.
   Each operation begins with an opcode of the form:

       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |    opcode     | imm. operand  |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Opcodes 0-16 directly decode to specific operations, and the lower half of
   the first byte contains an immediate operand value from 1-15 or a zero value
   that indicates that the immediate operand is contained in the next byte.
   Opcode 17 is a prefix for the subopcode contained in the lower half of the
   first byte in place of the immediate operand.  Opcode bytes are followed by
   zero or more operand bytes, depending on the operation.

   The opcodes and their assigned operations are:

     Opcode  SubOp  Mnem  Movement  Operation

   Implementation notes:

    1. The operation name table is indexed by the sum of the opcode and
       subopcode, where the latter is zero if the opcode is not extended.  This
       provides simple access to a single table.

/* Local command table.

   This table defines commands and command behaviors that are specific to this
   simulator.  One new command is defined, and several commands are repurposed
   or extended.  Specifically:

     * EXAMINE, DEPOSIT, IEXAMINE, and IDEPOSIT accept bank/offset form, implied
       DBANK offsets, and memory bank override switches.

     * RUN and GO accept implied PBANK offsets and reject bank/offset form and
       memory bank override switches.

     * BREAK and NOBREAK accept bank/offset form and implied PBANK offsets and
       reject memory bank override switches.

     * LOAD and DUMP invoke the CPU cold load/cold dump facility, rather than
       loading or dumping binary files.

     * POWER adds the ability to fail or restore power to the CPU.

   The table is initialized with only those fields that differ from the standard
   command table.  During one-time simulator initialization, the empty fields
   are filled in from the corresponding standard command table entries.  This
   ensures that the auxiliary table automatically picks up any changes to the
   standard commands that it modifies.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The RESET and BOOT commands are duplicated from the standard SCP command
       table so that entering "R" doesn't invoke the RUN command and entering
       "B" doesn't invoke the BREAK command.  This would otherwise occur because
       a VM-specific command table is searched before the standard command
       table.

/* Load and dump memory images from and to files.

   The LOAD and DUMP commands are intended to provide a basic method of loading
   and dumping programs into and from memory.  Typically, these commands operate
   on a simple, low-level format, e.g., a memory image.

   However, the HP 3000 requires the bank and segment registers being set up
   appropriately before execution.  In addition, the CPU microcode depends on
   segment tables being present in certain fixed memory locations as part of a
   program load.  These actions will not take place unless the system cold load
   facility is employed.

   Consequently, the LOAD and DUMP commands are repurposed to invoke the cold
   load and cold dump facilities, respectively, and this is a dummy routine that
   will never be called.  It is present only to satisfy the external declared in

   This routine prints a data value in the format specified by the optional
   switches on the output stream provided.  On entry, "ofile" is the opened
   output stream, and the other parameters depend on the reason the routine was
   called, as follows:

     * To print the next instruction mnemonic when the simulator stops:
        - addr = the program counter
        - val  = a pointer to sim_eval [0]
        - uptr = NULL
        - sw   = "-M" | SIM_SW_STOP

     * To print the result of EXAMining a register with REG_VMIO or a user flag:
        - addr = the ORed register radix and user flags
        - val  = a pointer to a single t_value
        - uptr = NULL
        - sw   = the command line switches | SIM_SW_REG

     * To print the result of EXAMining a memory address:
        - addr = the memory address
        - val  = a pointer to sim_eval [0]
        - uptr = a pointer to the named unit
        - sw   = the command line switches

     * To print the result of EVALuating a symbol:
        - addr = the symbol index
        - val  = a pointer to sim_eval [addr]
        - uptr = a pointer to the default unit (cpu_unit)
        - sw   = the command line switches

   On exit, a status code is returned to the caller.  If the format requested is
   not supported, SCPE_ARG status is returned, which causes the caller to print
   the value in numeric format with the default radix.  Otherwise, SCPE_OK
   status is returned if a single-word value was consumed, or the negative
   number of extra words (beyond the first) consumed in printing the symbol is
   returned.  For example, printing a two-word symbol would return
   SCPE_OK_2_WORDS (= -1).

   The following symbolic modes are supported by including the indicated
   switches on the command line:

     Switch   Display Interpretation
     ------   --------------------------------------------------
       -A     a single character in the right-hand byte
       -C     a two-character packed string
       -E     an EDIT instruction subprogram mnemonic
       -ER    an EDIT mnemonic starting with the right-hand byte
       -I     an I/O program instruction mnemonic
       -M     a CPU instruction mnemonic
       -T     a CPU status mnemonic

   In the absence of a mode switch, the value is displayed in a numeric format.

   When displaying data in one of the mnemonic modes, an additional switch may
   be specified to indicate the desired operand format, as follows:

     Switch   Operand Interpretation
     ------   --------------------------------------------------
       -A     a single character in the right-hand byte
       -B     a binary value
       -O     an octal value
       -D     a decimal value
       -H     a hexadecimal value

   Except for -B, these switches may be used without a mode switch to display a
   numeric value in the specified form.  To summarize, the valid switch
   combinations are:

     -A
     -C
     -E [ -R ] [ -A | -B | -O | -D | -H ]
     -I        [ -A | -B | -O | -D | -H ]
     -M        [ -A | -B | -O | -D | -H ]
     -T        [ -A | -B | -O | -D | -H ]

   When displaying mnemonics, operand values by default are displayed in a radix
   suitable to the type of the value.  Address values are displayed in the CPU's
   address radix, which is octal, and data values are displayed in the CPU's
   data radix, which defaults to octal but may be set to a different radix or
   overridden by a switch on the command line.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Because mnemonics are specific to the CPU/MPX/SEL, the CPU's radix
       settings are used, even if the unit is a peripheral.  For example,
       displaying disc sector data as CPU instructions uses the CPU's address
       and data radix values, rather than the disc's values.

    2. Displaying a register having a symbolic default format (e.g., CIR) will
       use the default unless the radix is overridden on the command line.  For
       example, "EXAMINE CIR" displays the CIR value as an instruction mnemonic,
       whereas "EXAMINE -D CIR" displays the value as decimal.  Adding "-M" will
       force mnemonic display and allow the radix switch to override the operand
       display.  For example, "EXAMINE -M -D CIR" displays the value as mnemonic
       and overrides the operand radix to decimal.

    3. We return SCPE_INVSW when multiple modes or formats are specified, but
       the callers do not act on this; they use the fallback formatter if any
       status error is returned.  We could work around this by printing "Invalid
       switch" to the console and returning SCPE_OK, but this does not stop
       IEXAMINE from prompting for the replacement value(s) or EXAMINE from
       printing a range.

    4. Radix switches and the -C switch are conceptually mutually exclusive.
       However, if we return an error when "format" is non-zero, then -C will be
       ignored, and the fallback formatter will use the radix switch.  The other
       choice is to process -C and ignore the radix switch; this is the option
       implemented.

    5. Because -A is both a mode and a format switch, we must check its presence
       using SYMBOLIC_SWITCHES separately from the other modes to allow (e.g.)
       both "EXAMINE -A" and "EXAMINE -M -A".  If -A is added to MODE_SWITCHES,
       the latter form would be rejected as having conflicting modes.

    6. The penultimate condition of the multiway "if-else if" mode test checks
       for no mode switches.  This succeeds when -A is specified alone because
       the earlier SYMBOLIC_SWITCHES test failed (so -A is present), but none of
       the other mode switches are present.

/* Parse a string in symbolic format.

   Parse the input string using the interpretation specified by the optional
   switches, and return the resulting value(s).  This routine is called to
   parse an input string when:

     - DEPOSITing into a register marked with a user flag
     - DEPOSITing into a memory address
     - EVALuating a symbol

   On entry, "cptr" points at the string to parse, "addr" is the register radix
   and flags, memory address, or 0 (respectively), "uptr" is NULL, a pointer to
   the named unit, or a pointer to the default unit (respectively), "val" is a
   pointer to an array of t_values of depth "sim_emax" representing the value(s)
   returned, and "sw" contains any switches passed on the command line.  "sw"
   also includes SIM_SW_REG for a register call.

   On exit, a status code is returned to the caller.  If the format requested is
   not supported or the parse failed, SCPE_ARG status is returned, which causes
   the caller to attempt to parse the value in numeric format.  Otherwise,
   SCPE_OK status is returned if the parse produced a single-word value, or the
   negative number of extra words (beyond the first) produced by parsing the
   symbol is returned.  For example, parsing a symbol that resulted in two words
   being stored (in val [0] and val [1]) would return SCPE_OK_2_WORDS (= -1).

   The following symbolic formats are supported by the listed switches:

     Switch   Interpretation
     ------   ----------------------------------
       -a     a single character the in low byte
       -c     a two-character packed string
       -o     override numeric input to octal
       -d     override numeric input to decimal
       -h     override numeric input to hex

   In the absence of switches, a leading ' implies "-a", a leading " implies
   "-c", and a leading alphabetic character implies an instruction mnemonic.  If
   a single character is supplied with "-c", the low byte of the resulting value
   will be zero; follow the character with a space if the low byte is to be
   padded  with a space.

   Caution must be exercised when entering hex values without a leading digit.
   A value that is the same as an instruction mnemonic will be interpreted as
   the latter unless overridden by the "-h" switch.  For example, "ADD" is an
   instruction mnemonic, but "ADE" is a hex value.  To avoid confusion, always
   enter hex values with the "-h" switch or with a leading zero (i.e., "0ADD").

   When entering mnemonics, operand values are parsed in a radix suitable to the
   type of the value.  Address values are parsed in the CPU's address radix,
   which is octal, and data values are parsed in the CPU's data radix, which
   defaults to octal but may be set to a different radix or overridden by a
   switch on the command line.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Because the mnemonics are specific to the CPU/MPX/SEL, the CPU's radix
       settings are used, even if the unit is a peripheral.  For example,
       entering disc sector data as CPU instructions uses the CPU's address and
       data radix values, rather than the disc's values.

    2. The "cptr" post-increments are logically ANDed with the tests for ' and "
       so that the increments are performed only if the tests succeed.  The
       intent is to skip over the leading ' or " character.  The increments
       themselves always succeed, so they don't affect the outcome of the tests.

/* Set a device configuration value.

   This validation routine is called to set a device's I/O configuration (device
   number, interrupt mask, interrupt priority, and service request number).  The
   "uptr" parameter points to the unit being configured, "code" is a validation
   constant (VAL_DEVNO, VAL_INTMASK, VAL_INTPRI, or VAL_SRNO), "cptr" points to
   the first character of the value to be set, and "desc" points to the DIB
   associated with the device.

   If the supplied value is acceptable, it is stored in the DIB, and the routine
   returns SCPE_OK.  Otherwise, an error code is returned.

   For the following validation constants, the acceptable ranges of values are:

     VAL_DEVNO   -- 0-127
     VAL_INTMASK -- 0-15 | E | D
     VAL_INTPRI  -- 0-31
     VAL_SRNO    -- 0-15


   Implementation notes:

    1. For a numeric interrupt mask entry value <n>, the value stored in the DIB
       is 2 ^ <15 - n> to match the HP 3000 bit numbering.  For mask entry
       values "D" and "E", the stored values are 0 and 0177777, respectively.

    2. The SCMB is the only device that may or may not have a service request
       number, depending on whether or not it is connected to the multiplexer
       channel bus.  Therefore, the current request number must be valid before
       it may be changed.

/* Print a CPU instruction in symbolic format.

   This routine is called to format and print an instruction in mnemonic form.
   The "ofile" parameter is the opened output stream, "val [*]" contains the
   word(s) comprising the machine instruction to print, "radix" contains the
   desired operand radix or zero if the default radix is to be used, and
   "switches" includes the SIM_SW_STOP switch if the routine was called as part
   of a simulation stop.

   The routine returns a status code to the caller.  SCPE_OK status is returned
   if the print consumed a single-word value, or the negative number of extra
   words (beyond the first) consumed by printing the instruction is returned.
   For example, printing a symbol that resulted in two words being consumed
   (from val [0] and val [1]) would return SCPE_OK_2_WORDS (= -1).

   HP 3000 machine instructions are generally classified by the first four bits.
   Within each class, additional bits identify sub-classes or individual
   instructions.

   Most of the decoding work is handled by the "fprint_instruction" routine,
   which prints mnemonics and operands and returns a status code indicating the
   number of words consumed for the current instruction.


   Implementation notes:

    1. For a stack instruction, if the R (right stack-op pending) bit in the
       status word is set, and the request is for a simulation stop, the
       left-hand opcode will print as dashes to indicate that it has already
       been executed.

    2. The status return from "fprint_instruction" is always SCPE_OK for the
       stack_ops table, which is fully decoded, so the return value from
       printing the left stack opcode is not used.

/* Print an EDIT instruction subprogram operation in symbolic format.

   This routine prints a single EDIT subprogram operation.  The opcode name is
   obtained from the name table and printed, followed by the operands.

   On entry, the "ofile" parameter is the opened output stream, "val" is NULL or
   points to an array containing the first two words of the operation, "radix"
   contains the desired operand radix or zero if the default radix is to be
   used, and "byte_address" points at the first byte of the subprogram
   operation.  The return value is the number of subprogram bytes used by the
   operation.

   This routine is called by the SCP "EXAMINE" command processor to display an
   EDIT subprogram contained in memory in symbolic format.  It is also called
   by the EDIT instruction executor when tracing memory operands.  In the former
   case, the "EXAMINE" command has obtained two words from memory and placed
   them in the array pointed to by the "val" parameter.  In the latter case,
   "val" will be NULL, indicating that the array must be loaded explicitly.  In
   either case, additional memory bytes are obtained as needed by the operation
   decoder.

   For each operation, the following type of operand and the number of bytes
   required are listed below:

     'c'      character value 0 .. 255
     "s"      string value of 0 .. 255 characters

   Note that in only three cases must additional memory accesses be performed.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Operation decoding is simplified by translating the prefix opcode (17)
       and subopcodes (00-11) into extended opcodes 17+0 to 17+11 (17-30).

    2. Branch operation displacements are printed as positive to indicate a
       forward jump and negative to indicate a backward jump.  The radix used is
       the CPU's address radix, which is octal.

    3. The Machine Instruction Set manual says that the DBNZ ("decrement loop
       count and branch") operation adds the displacement operand.  However,
       the microcode manual shows that the displacement is actually subtracted.
       Therefore, we print the operand as a negative value to conform with the
       hardware action.

    4. A simple GET_BYTE macro is defined for easy access to the bytes contained
       in the "val" array.  The macro also increments the byte address and
       increments the word array pointer as needed.

   This routine formats a single 8-bit character value into a printable string
   and returns a pointer to that string.  Printable characters retain their
   original form but are enclosed in single quotes.  Control characters are
   translated to readable strings.  Characters outside of the ASCII range are
   presented as escaped octal values.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The longest string to be returned is a five-character escaped string
       consisting of a backslash, three octal digits, and a trailing NUL.  The
       end-of-buffer pointer has an allowance to ensure that the string will
       fit.

    2. The routine returns a pointer to a static buffer containing the printable
       string.  To allow the routine to be called more than once per trace line,
       the null-terminated format strings are concatenated in the buffer, and
       each call returns a pointer that is offset into the buffer to point at
       the latest formatted string.

    3. There is no explicit buffer-free action.  Instead, newly formatted
       strings are appended to the buffer until there is no more space
       available.  At that point, the pointers are reset to the start of the
       buffer.  In effect, this provides a circular buffer, as previously
       formatted strings are overwritten by subsequent calls.

    4. The buffer is sized to hold the maximum number of concurrent strings
       needed for a single trace line.  If more concurrent strings are used, one
       or more strings from the earliest calls will be overwritten.

/* Format a set of named bits.

   This routine formats a set of up to 32 named bits into a printable string and
   returns a pointer to that string.  The names of the active bits are
   concatenated and separated by vertical bars.  For example:

     SIO OK | ready | no error | unit 0

   On entry, "bitset" is a value specifying the bits to format, and "bitfmt" is
   a BITSET_FORMAT structure describing the format to use.  The structure
   contains a count and a pointer to an array of character strings specifying
   the names of the valid bits in "bitset", the offset in bits from the LSB to
   the least-significant named bit, the direction in which to process the bits
   (from MSB to LSB, or vice versa), whether or not alternate names are present
   in the name array, and whether or not to append a final separator.  The names
   in the name array appear in the order corresponding to the supplied
   direction; invalid bits are indicated by NULL character names.  The pointer
   returned points at a character buffer containing the names of the valid bits
   that are set in the supplied value.  If no valid bits are set, then the
   buffer contains "(none)" if a trailing separator is omitted, or a null string
   ("") if a trailing separator is requested.

   The name_count and names fields describe the separately defined name string
   array.  The array must start with the first valid bit but need only contain
   entries through the last valid bit; NULL entries for the remaining bits in
   the word are not necessary.  For example, if bits 1-3 of a word are valid,
   then the name string array would have three entries.  If bits 1-3 and 5 are
   valid, then the array would have five entries, with the fourth entry set to
   NULL.

   The offset field specifies the number of unnamed bits to the right of the
   least-significant named bit.  Using the same examples as above, the offsets
   would be 12 and 10, respectively.

   The direction field specifies whether the bits are named from MSB to LSB
   (msb_first) or vice versa (lsb_first).  The order of the entries in the name
   string array must match the direction specified.  Continuing with the first
   example above, if the direction is msb_first, then the first name is for bit
   1; if the direction is lsb_first, then the first name is for bit 3.

   The alternate field specifies whether (has_alt) or not (no_alt) alternate
   conditions are represented by one or more bits.  Generally, bits represent
   Boolean conditions, e.g., a condition is present when the bit is 1 and absent
   when the bit is zero.  In these cases, the corresponding bit name is included
   or omitted, respectively, in the return string.

   Occasionally, bits will represent alternate conditions, e.g., where condition
   A is present when the bit is 1, and condition B is present when the bit is 0.
   For these, the bit name string should consist of both condition names in that
   order, with the "1" name preceded by the '\1' character and the "0" name
   preceded by the '\0' character.  For example, if 1 corresponds to "load" and
   0 to "store", then the bit name string would be "\1load\0store".  If
   alternate names are present, the has_alt identifier should be given, so that
   the indicated bits are checked for zero conditions.  If no_alt is specified,
   the routine stops as soon as all of the one-bits have been processed.

   The bar field specifies whether (append_bar) or not (no_bar) a vertical bar
   separator is appended to the formatted string.  Typically, a bitset
   represents a peripheral control or status word.  If the word also contains
   multiple-bit fields, a trailing separator should be requested, and the
   decoded fields should be concatenated by the caller with any named bits.  If
   the bitset is empty, the returned null string will present the proper display
   containing just the decoded fields.  If the bitset completely describes the
   word, then no appended separator is needed.

   Peripheral control and status words generally are decoded from MSB to LSB.  A
   bitset may also represent a set of inbound or outbound signals.  These should
   be decoded from LSB to MSB, as that is the order in which they are executed
   by the device interface routines.

   The implementation first generates a mask for the significant bits and
   positions the mask with the offset specified.  Then a test bit mask is
   generated; the bit is either the most- or least-significant bit of the
   bitset, depending on the direction indicated.

   For each name in the array of names, if the name is defined (not NULL), the
   corresponding bit in the bitset is tested.  If it is set, the name is
   appended to the output buffer; otherwise, it is omitted (unless the name has
   an alternate, in which case the alternate is appended).  The bitset is then
   shifted in the indicated direction, remasking to just the significant bits.
   Processing continues until there are no remaining significant bits (if no
   alternates are specified), or until there are no remaining names in the array
   (if alternates are specified).


   Implementation notes:

    1. The routine returns a pointer to a static buffer containing the printable
       string.  To allow the routine to be called more than once per trace line,
       the null-terminated format strings are concatenated in the buffer, and
       each call returns a pointer that is offset into the buffer to point at
       the latest formatted string.

    2. There is no explicit buffer-free action.  Instead, newly formatted
       strings are appended to the buffer until there is no more space
       available.  At that point, the string currently being assembled is moved
       to the start of the buffer, and the pointers are reset.  In effect, this
       provides a circular buffer, as previously formatted strings are
       overwritten by subsequent calls.

    3. The buffer is sized to hold the maximum number of concurrent strings
       needed for a single trace line.  If more concurrent strings are used, one
       or more strings from the earliest calls will be overwritten.  If an
       attempt is made to format a string larger than the buffer, an error
       indication string is returned.

    4. The location of the end of the buffer used to determine if the next name
       will fit includes an allowance for two separators that might be placed on
       either side of the name and a terminating NUL character.

/* Format and print a debugging trace line to the debug log.

   A formatted line is assembled and sent to the previously opened debug output
   stream.  On entry, "dptr" points to the device issuing the trace, "flag" is
   the debug flag that has enabled the trace, and the remaining parameters
   consist of the format string and associated values.

   This routine is usually not called directly but rather via the "dprintf"
   macro, which tests that debugging is enabled for the specified flag before
   calling this function.  This eliminates the calling overhead if debugging is
   disabled.

   This routine prints a prefix before the supplied format string consisting of
   the device name (in upper case) and the debug flag name (in lower case),
   e.g.:

     >>MPX state: Channel SR 3 entered State A
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        prefix       supplied format string

   The names are padded to the lengths of the largest device name and debug flag
   name among the devices enabled for debugging to ensure that all trace lines
   will align for easier reading.


   Implementation notes:

    1. ISO C99 allows assignment expressions as the bounds for array
       declarators.  VC++ 2008 requires constant expressions.  To accommodate
       the latter, we must allocate "sufficiently large" arrays for the flag
       name and format, rather than arrays of the exact size required by the
       call parameters.

/* Check for device conflicts.

   The device information blocks (DIBs) for the set of enabled devices are
   checked for consistency.  Each device number, interrupt priority number, and
   service request number must be unique among the enabled devices.  These
   requirements are checked as part of the instruction execution prelude; this
   allows the user to exchange two device numbers (e.g.) simply by setting each
   device to the other's device number.  If conflicts were enforced instead at
   the time the numbers were entered, the first device would have to be set to
   an unused number before the second could be set to the first device's number.

   The routine begins by filling in a DIB value table from all of the device
   DIBs to allow indexed access to the values to be checked.  Unused DIB values
   and values corresponding to devices that have no DIBs or are disabled are set
   to the corresponding UNUSED constants.

   As part of the device scan, the sizes of the largest device name and active
   debug flag name among the devices enabled for debugging are accumulated for
   use in aligning the debug tracing statements.

   After the DIB value table is filled in, a conflict check is made for each
   conflict type (i.e., device number, interrupt priority, or service request
   number).  For each check, a conflict table is built, where each array element
   is set to the count of devices that contain DIB values equal to the element
   index.  For example, when processing device number values, conflict table
   element 6 is set to the count of devices that have dibptr->device_number set
   to 6.  If any conflict table element is set more than once, the "conflict_is"
   variable is set to the type of conflict.

   If any conflicts exist for the current type, the conflict table is scanned.
   A conflict table element value (i.e., device count) greater than 1 indicates
   a conflict.  For each such value, the DIB value table is scanned to find
   matching values, and the device names associated with the matching values are
   printed.

   This routine returns TRUE if any conflicts exist and FALSE there are none.


   Implementation notes:

    1. When this routine is called, the console and optional log file have
       already been put into "raw" output mode.  Therefore, newlines are not
       translated to the correct line ends on systems that require it.  Before
       reporting a conflict, "sim_ttcmd" is called to restore the console and
       log file translation.  This is OK because a conflict will abort the run
       and return to the command line anyway.

    2. sim_dname is called instead of using dptr->name directly to ensure that
       we pick up an assigned logical device name.

    3. Only the names of active trace (debug) options are accumulated to produce
       the most compact trace log.  However, if the CPU device's EXEC option is
       enabled, then all of the CPU option names are accumulated, as EXEC
       enables all trace options for a given instruction or instruction class.

    4. Even though the routine is called only from the sim_instr routine in the
       CPU simulator module, it must be located here to use the DEVICE_COUNT
       constant to allocate the dib_val matrix.  If it were located in the CPU
       module, the matrix would have to be allocated dynamically after a
       run-time determination of the count of simulator devices.

/* Format and print a VM simulation stop message.

   When the instruction loop is exited, a simulation stop message is printed and
   control returns to SCP.  An SCP stop prints a message with this format:

     <reason>, P: <addr> (<inst>)

   For example:

     SCPE_STOP prints "Simulation stopped, P: 24713 (LOAD 1)"
     SCPE_STEP prints "Step expired, P: 24713 (LOAD 1)"

   For VM stops, this routine is called after the message has been printed and
   before the comma and program counter label and value are printed.  Depending
   on the reason for the stop, the routine may insert additional information,
   and it may request omission of the PC value by returning FALSE instead of
   TRUE.

   This routine modifies the default output for these stop codes:

     STOP_SYSHALT prints "System halt 3, P: 24713 (LOAD 1)"
     STOP_HALT    prints "Programmed halt, CIR: 030365 (HALT 5), P: 24713 (LOAD 1)"
     STOP_CDUMP   prints "Cold dump complete, CIR: 000020"


   Implementation notes:

    1. HALT instructions are always one word in length, so only sim_eval [0]
       needs to be set up before calling fprint_cpu.

    2. The system halt reason is present in RA.

/* Parse a memory address.

   This routine is called by SCP to parse memory addresses.  It is also called
   to parse values to be stored in registers tagged with the REG_VMAD flag.

   On entry, the "dptr" parameter points to the device to which the address
   refers, and "cptr" points to the first character of the address operand on
   the command line.  On exit, the linear address is returned, and the pointer
   pointed to by "tptr" is set to point at the first character after the parsed
   address.  Parsing errors, including use of features disallowed by the command
   in process, are indicated by the "tptr" pointer being set to "cptr".

   The HP 3000 divides memory into 64K-word banks.  Each bank is identified by a
   bank address from 0-15.  The current bank addresses for the program, data,
   and stack segments are kept in the PBANK, DBANK, and SBANK registers.

   The simulator supports only linear addresses for all devices other than the
   CPU.  For the CPU, two forms of address entries are allowed:

     - an absolute address consisting of a 4-bit bank address and a 16-bit
       offset within the bank, separated by a period (e.g., 17.177777)

     - a relative address consisting of a 16-bit offset within a bank specified
       by a bank register (e.g., 177777).

   Command line switches modify the interpretation of relative addresses as
   follows:

     * -P specifies an implied bank address obtained from PBANK
     * -S specifies an implied bank address obtained from SBANK
     * no switch specifies an implied bank address obtained from DBANK

   The "parse_config" global specifies the allowed parse configurations.  For
   example, the memory examine/deposit commands allow both absolute addresses
   and offsets from any of the three bank registers, whereas the run command
   only allows an implied offset from PBANK.

/* Print an I/O program instruction in symbolic format.

   This routine prints a pair of data words as an I/O channel order and the

   On entry, the "ofile" parameter is the opened output stream, "val [0]"
   contains the I/O Control Word, "val [1]" contains the I/O Address Word, and
   "radix" contains the desired operand radix or zero if the default radix is to
   be used.  The control and address words are decoded as follows:

     0 1 2 3       4-15            0-15              Action

     C 1 1 0  Neg Word Count  Write Address   Write
     C 1 1 1  Neg Word Count  Read Address    Read

   Operand values are printed in a radix suitable to the type of the value, as
   follows:

     - Address values are printed in the CPU's address radix, which is octal.

     - Counts are printed by default in decimal.

     - Control and status values are printed in the CPU's data radix, which
       defaults to octal.

   The radix for operand values other than addresses may be overridden by a
   switch on the command line.  A value printed in a radix other than the
   current data radix is preceded by a radix identifier ("@" for binary, "%" for
   octal, "#" for decimal, or "!" for hexadecimal).

   The routine returns SCPE_OK_2_WORDS to indicate that two words were consumed.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The Return Residue and Read/Write count values are printed as positive
       numbers, even though the values in memory are negative.

/* Format and print an EDIT instruction subprogram operation in symbolic format.

   This routine formats and prints a set of memory bytes as an EDIT subprogram
   operation.  It is called when the "-E" command-line switch is included with a
   memory display request.

   On entry, the "ofile" parameter is the opened output stream, "val [*]"
   contains the first two words of the operation, "radix" contains the desired
   operand radix or zero if the default radix is to be used, "addr" points at
   the memory word containing the first subprogram operation byte, and
   "switches" contains the set of command-line switches supplied with the
   command.  The return value is one more than the negative number of memory
   words consumed by the print request (e.g., a one-word consumption returns
   zero, a two-word consumption returns -1, etc.).

   The routine is called to print a single memory word.  If the EXAMINE command
   is given a memory range, the routine will be called multiple times, with
   "val" pointing at an array containing the first two words of the range.

   An operation may encompass from 1-257 bytes.  The operation is assumed to
   begin in the upper byte of the first memory word unless the "-R" switch is
   supplied, in which case the lower byte is assumed.  If "-R" is not used, and
   the operation in the upper byte consumes only a single byte, the operation
   (beginning) in the lower byte is also printed.

   Full operations are always printed, so a single call on the routine prints
   one or two operations and then returns the number of memory words consumed
   (biased by 1).  If a range is being printed, this value determines the
   address presented at the following call.

   Before returning, the "R" switch is set or cleared to indicate whether the
   next call in a range should start with the lower or upper byte of the word.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Within a single command, this routine may be called (via fprint_sym)
       successively for the same address.  This will occur if console logging is
       enabled.  The first call will be to write to the console, and then it
       will be called again to write to the log file.  However, sim_switches is
       updated after the first call in anticipation of additional calls for the
       subsequent addresses in a range.  To avoid this, sim_switches is tested
       only if the routine is NOT called for the log file; if it is, then the
       previous setting of sim_switches is used.

/* Print a CPU instruction and operand in symbolic format.

   This routine prints a CPU instruction and its operand, if any, using the
   mnemonics specified in the Machine Instruction Set and Systems Programming
   Language Reference manuals.  Specified bits in the instruction word are used
   as an index into a supplied classification table.  The entry corresponding to
   the instruction gives the mnemonic string, operand type, and reserved bits
   (if any).

   On entry, the "ofile" parameter is the opened output stream, "ops" is the
   table of classifications containing the instruction, "val" contains the
   word(s) of the machine instruction to print, "mask" is the opcode mask to
   apply to get the index bits, "shift" is the right-shift count to align the
   index, and "radix" contains the desired operand radix or zero if the default
   radix is to be used.

   On exit, a status code is returned to the caller.  SCPE_OK status is returned
   if the print consumed a single-word value, or the negative number of extra
   words (beyond the first) consumed by printing the instruction is returned.
   For example, printing a symbol that resulted in two words being consumed
   (from val [0] and val [1]) would return SCPE_OK_2_WORDS (= -1).  If the
   supplied instruction is not in the table, SCPE_ARG is returned.

   The classification table consists of a set of entries that are indexed by
   opcode, followed optionally by a set of entries that are searched linearly.
   Empty mnemonics, i.e., "", are used in the indexed part to indicate that the
   linear part must be searched, and in the linear part to indicate a two-word
   instruction whose second word did not match a defined entry.  A NULL mnemonic
   ends the array (this allows string searches for parsing to fail without
   aborting).

   The supplied instruction is ANDed with the "mask" parameter and then
   right-shifted by the "shift" parameter to produce an index into the "ops"
   table.  If the entry contains a non-empty mnemonic string, it is printed.
   Otherwise, starting at the index implied by the size of the mask, i.e., at
   mask + 1, a linear search of the entries is performed.  For each entry, the
   instruction is masked to remove the operand and optionally the reserved bits,
   and the result is compared to the base opcode.  If it matches, the associated
   mnemonic is printed.  If the table is exhausted without a match, the
   instruction is undefined, and SCPE_ARG is returned.

   For defined instructions, the operand, if any, is printed after the mnemonic.
   Operand values are printed in a radix suitable to the type of the value, as
   follows:

     - Register-relative displacements, S-register decrements, and K fields are
       printed in the CPU's address radix, which is octal.

     - Shift counts, bit positions, and starting bits and counts are printed in
       decimal.

     - CIR values for the PAUS and HALT instructions are printed in octal.

     - Immediate values are printed in the CPU's data radix, which defaults to
       octal but may be set to a different radix with SET CPU OCT|DEC|HEX.

   The radix for operand values other than addresses may be overridden by a
   switch on the command line.  A value printed in a radix other than the
   current data radix is preceded by a radix identifier ("%" for octal, "#" for
   decimal, or "!" for hexadecimal).


   Implementation notes:

    1. All instructions in the base set are single words.  However, some
       extension instructions, including instructions for later-series CPUs,
       e.g., the Series 33, use two words.  For example, the WIOC (write I/O
       channel) instruction is the two-word sequence 020302,000003, and the SIOP
       (start I/O program) sequence is 020302,000000.

    2. The operand type dispatch handlers either set up operand printing by
       assigning the prefix, indirect, and index values, or print the operand(s)
       directly if special formatting is required.

    3. Register flags for the PSHR and SETR instructions are printed using the
       SPL register names.

    4. The "rsvd_mask" fields of secondary entries for one-word instructions
       have the upper 16 bits of the values set to zero.  This masks off the
       second instruction word, which is arbitrary, before comparison.

    5. A secondary entry with a zero-length mnemonic is used to match the first
       word of a two-word instruction when the second word fails to match any of
       the earlier entries.  This causes the instruction to be printed as a pair
       of numeric values.
