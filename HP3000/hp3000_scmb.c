   The HP 30033A Selector Channel Maintenance Board provides the circuitry
   necessary to test the I/O bus signals driven and received by the selector and
   multiplexer channels.  Used with the Stand-Alone Selector Channel and
   Multiplexer Channel diagnostics, the SCMB is used to verify that the correct
   bus signals are driven in response to each of the programmed I/O orders, and
   that the channel responds correctly to the signals returned to it.  The SCMB
   functions as a programmable interface that can log incoming signals and drive
   the outgoing signals, as well as simulate a number of interface hardware
   faults.  Two SCMBs are required to test the multiplexer channel fully, so two
   SCMBs are provided; they are named "SCMB" (or "SCMB1") and "SCMB2".

   In hardware, the SCMB is connected either to the selector channel or
   multiplexer channel buses, and jumper W1 must be set to the SC or MX
   position, depending on the desired diagnostic test.  The device number and
   the service request number jumpers may be configured to use any unassigned
   numbers.

   In simulation, a SET SCMB SC configures the interface for the selector
   channel diagnostic, and a SET SCMB MX configures the interface for the
   multiplexer diagnostic.  If the selector channel diagnostic is run with SET
   SCMB MX, the SCMB itself is tested.  The multiplexer diagnostic requires two
   SCMB cards, so SET SCMB1 MX and SET SCMB2 MX are required.


   The SCMB responds to direct and programmed I/O instructions, as follows:

   Control Word Format (CIO):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | M | R | J | V | A | S | load  | H | N | T | C | L |  counter  |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     M = master reset
     R = reset interrupt
     J = set jump met condition
     V = set device end condition
     A = inhibit channel acknowledge
     S = inhibit service request
     H = enable high speed service request
     N = enable special device number
     T = terminate on terminal count
     C = terminate on compare failure
     L = enable clear interface on terminate

   Load:
     00 = load the IOAW into the control word
     01 = load the IOCW into the buffer
     10 = load the IOAW into the buffer
     11 = load the IOCW and then the IOAW into the buffer

   Counter:
     000 = counter is disabled
     001 = count READNEXTWD signals
     010 = count PREADSTB signals
     011 = count TOGGLEINXFER signals
     100 = count PWRITESTB signals
     101 = count TOGGLEOUTXFER signals
     110 = count EOT signals
     111 = count CHANSO signals

   The Load field defines how programmed I/O orders will affect the control word
   and buffer.  The Counter field defines which signal occurrences, if any, are
   counted.  If value 000 is selected, the counter does not operate, and the
   buffer value does not change.


   Control Word Format (SIO Control):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 1   0   0 |                 buffer value                  |  word 1
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | M | R | J | V | A | S | load  | H | N | T | C | L |  counter  |  word 2
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   If the current control word specifies a Load field value of 01, word 1 is
   loaded into the counter/buffer register.  Otherwise, word 2 is loaded into
   the control word register or counter/buffer register, depending on the Load
   field value.

   If the A bit (inhibit channel acknowledge) is set, CHANACK will be issued for
   this Control order, but all future orders will not be acknowledged.
   Similarly, if the S bit (inhibit service request) is set, a CHANSR will be
   issued for this order but not for future orders.


   Status Word Format (TIO and SIO Status):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | S | D | R | A | X | N | V | E | C | T | I | O | L | 0   0   0 |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

     S = SIO OK
     D = direct I/O OK (always 1)
     R = interrupt requested
     A = interrupt active
     X = transfer error was asserted
     N = SIO enabled is asserted
     V = device end was asserted
     E = end of transfer was asserted
     C = an end-on-miscompare occurred
     T = an end-on-terminal-count occurred
     I = an input transfer is in progress
     O = an output transfer is in progress
     L = a clear interface has asserted to abort the I/O program

   Note that the Series II Service Manual and the Series III CE Handbook list
   the wrong assignments for status bits 8-11.  The Selector Channel Diagnostic
   manual has the correct assignments.


   Output Data Word Format (WIO and SIO Write):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |               new counter/buffer register value               |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   If the control word C bit (terminate on compare failure) is set, the current
   counter/buffer value is compared to the new value.  If they are not equal,
   the C bit (an end-on-miscompare occurred) is set in the status word.

   The new value is stored in the counter/buffer register only if the control
   word Counter field value is less than 100 (i.e., it is not set to count
   writes).  Otherwise, the value is ignored, but the write is counted.

   If DEVEND is asserted for a selector channel SIO Write, the write is ignored,
   and the PWRITESTB signal is not counted.


   Input Data Word Format (RIO and SIO Read):

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |             current counter/buffer register value             |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   If DEVEND is asserted for a selector channel SIO Read, the read is ignored,
   and the PREADSTB signal is not counted.

/* SCMB local SCP support routines */



/* Selector Channel Maintenance Board interface.

   The interface is installed on the IOP bus and either the Multiplexer or
   Selector Channel bus and receives direct and programmed I/O commands from the
   IOP and channel, respectively.  In simulation, the asserted signals on the
   buses are represented as bits in the inbound_signals set.  Each signal is
   processed sequentially in numerical order, and a set of similar
   outbound_signals is assembled and returned to the caller, simulating
   assertion of the corresponding backplane signals.

   Jumper W1 on the interface PCA must be set to match the bus (multiplexer or
   selector) to which the SCMB is connected.  The multiplexer and selector
   channels have slightly different signal requirements, and this jumper
   configures the logic to account for the difference.

   The diagnostics use direct I/O to configure the SCMB and then use programmed
   I/O to test the channel's interaction with the interface.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, asserting DSTARTIO sets the Channel SR flip-flop, but the
       output is masked off unless the SCMB is connected to the multiplexer
       channel (the selector channel does not use the Channel SR flip-flop).
       In simulation, setting the flip-flop is inhibited.

    2. In hardware, asserting DEVEND to the selector channel inhibits
       generation of the PREADSTB and PWRITESTB signals.  In simulation, DEVEND
       is returned in response to a PREADSTB or PWRITESTB if the Device End
       flip-flop is set.  As the strobes may cause the counter to increment,
       counting is inhibited in simulation if the Device End flip-flop is set
       and the SCMB is on the selector channel bus.

    3. In hardware, the SCMB does not use ACKSR to reset the Device SR
       flip-flop.  Instead, the flip-flop is preset by PCMD1 or PCONTSTB or if
       the Input Transfer or Output Transfer flip-flop is set; it is clocked to
       zero by the leading edge of CHANSO.  In simulation, the Device SR
       flip-flop is cleared on entry by CHANSO if both the Input and Output
       Transfer flip-flops are clear.  This provides the same action as the
       asynchronous set overriding the synchronous clear in hardware.

    4. If channel acknowledgement is inhibited, the CHANACK signal is not
       returned to the selector channel.  This causes a CHANSO timeout in the
       channel.  Similarly, if channel service requests are inhibited, CHANSR
       will not be returned to the selector channel, which will cause a timeout
       and channel abort.

    5. In hardware, clearing the "enable high speed service request" bit in the
       control word delays SR assertion for five microseconds after the device
       SR flip-flop sets.  In software, the SCMB unit service routine is
       scheduled and the request signal is not returned from the interface; when
       the delay expires, the service routine calls either "mpx_assert_SRn" or
       "sel_assert_CHANSR" to request channel service.

       However, if the "inhibit channel acknowledge" or "inhibit service
       request" bit in the control word is also set, then scheduling of the
       service routine is inhibited.  Otherwise, SR would be asserted after the
       channel had been aborted by the timeout.

    6. In hardware, setting the "enable special device number" bit in the
       control word causes the SCMB to gate bits 8-15 of the counter/buffer
       register onto SR6-13 for the DSTARTIO signal only.  This supplies the
       selector channel with a configurable device number instead of that of the
       SCMB.  For all other operations, e.g., interrupts, the regular SCMB
       device number is used.

       In simulation, the device number is obtained from the DIB passed to the
       "sel_assert_REQ" routine.  If the special bit is set, the device number
       is changed temporarily before calling "sel_assert_REQ" and then restored
       afterward.  This ensures that interrupts in particular are handled
       correctly.  (An alternate method of passing a secondary DIB containing
       the special device number won't work, as the selector channel will use
       the secondary DIB to request an interrupt, but the IOP will use the
       standard DIB to respond to the interrupt.)

    7. Receipt of a DRESETINT signal clears the interrupt request and active
       flip-flops but does not cancel a request pending but not yet serviced by
       the IOP.  However, when the IOP does service the request by asserting
       INTPOLLIN, the interface routine returns INTPOLLOUT, which will cancel
       the request.

    8. Although support for the "count_CHANSO" option is provided, none of the
       diagnostics (SCMB, MPX, and SEL) test this option.

    9. In simulation, we allow the device number to be changed during a
       simulation stop.  However, the SCMB may be spoofing the device number,
       and it is this spoofed number that must be restored during the channel
       initialization that follows resumption.  This presents no problem to the
       multiplexer channel, which asserts DEVNODB to the interface as part of
       each I/O order execution.  However, the selector channel requests the
       device number once during the REQ assertion that starts the I/O program
       and saves it internally for later use.

       To accommodate changing device numbers while spoofing is enabled, the
       selector channel simulator asserts DEVNODB to the interface during
       initialization.  The SCMB responds to the DEVNODB signal, as it supports
       connection to the multiplexer channel.  Devices that connect only to the
       selector channel will not respond to DEVNODB, causing the initializer to
       use the DIB field to obtain the device number.
