   The HP 30030C Selector Channel provides high-speed data transfer between a
   device and main memory.  While several interfaces may be connected to the
   selector channel bus, only one transfer is active at a time, and the channel
   remains dedicated to that interface until the transfer is complete.  The
   channel contains its own memory port controller, so transfers to and from
   memory bypass the I/O Processor.

   Interfaces must have additional hardware to be channel-capable, as the
   channel uses separate control and data signals from those used for direct
   I/O.  In addition, the multiplexer and selector channels differ somewhat in
   their use of the signals, so interfaces are generally designed for use with
   one or the other (the Selector Channel Maintenance Board is a notable
   exception that uses jumpers to indicate which channel to use).

   The transfer rate of the Series III selector channel is poorly documented.
   Various rates are quoted in different publications: a 1.9 MB/second rate in
   one, a 2.86 MB/second rate in another.  Main memory access time is given as
   300 nanoseconds, and the cycle time is 700 nanoseconds.

   Once started by an SIO instruction, the channel executes I/O programs
   independently of the CPU.  Program words are read, and device status is
   written back, directly via the port controller.

   32-bit I/O program words are formed from a 16-bit I/O control word (IOCW) and
   a 16-bit I/O address word (IOAW) in this general format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | C |   order   | X |       control word 1/word count           |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                 control word 2/status/address                 |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Most orders are fully decoded by bits 1-3, but a few use bit 4 to extend the
   definition where bits 4-15 are not otherwise used.  I/O programs always
   reside in memory bank 0.  The current I/O program pointer resides in word 0
   of the Device Reference Table entry for the active interface.

   The Jump and Jump Conditional orders use this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   0   0 | C | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                      jump target address                      |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   ...where C is 0 for an unconditional jump and 1 for a conditional jump.  An
   unconditional jump is handled entirely within the channel.  A conditional
   jump asserts the SETJMP signal to the interface.  If the interface returns
   JMPMET, the jump will occur; otherwise, execution continues with the next
   program word.

   The Return Residue order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   0   1   0 | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                     residue of word count                     |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The remaining word count from the last transfer will be returned in the IOAW
   as a two's-complement value.  If the transfer completed normally, the
   returned value will be zero.

   The Set Bank order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   0   1   1 | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |     bank      |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   This establishes the memory bank to be used for subsequent Write or Read
   orders.  Program addresses always use bank 0.

   The Interrupt order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   1   0 | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The SETINT signal is asserted to the interface for this order.

   The End and End with Interrupt orders use this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 0   1   1 | I | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                         device status                         |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   ...where I is 0 for an End and 1 for an End with Interrupt.  The PSTATSTB
   signal is asserted to the interface to obtain the device status, which is
   stored in the IOAW location.  If the I bit is set, SETINT will also be
   asserted,

   The Control order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 1   0   0 |                control word 1                 |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                        control word 2                         |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Both control words are sent to the interface.  The full IOCW containing
   control word 1 is sent with the PCMD1 signal asserted.  It is followed by the
   IOAW with PCONTSTB asserted.

   The Sense order uses this format:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | - | 1   0   1 | -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                         device status                         |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The PSTATSTB signal is asserted to the interface to obtain the device status,
   which is stored in the IOAW location.

   The Write and Read orders use these formats:

       0 | 1   2   3 | 4   5   6 | 7   8   9 |10  11  12 |13  14  15
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | C | 1   1   0 |         negative word count to write          |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | C | 1   1   1 |          negative word count to read          |  IOCW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     |                       transfer address                        |  IOAW
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   The C bit is the "data chain" flag.  If it is set, then this transfer is a
   continuation of a previous Write or Read transfer.  This is used to
   circumvent the transfer size limitation inherent in the 12-bit word count
   allocated in the IOCW.  For single transfers larger than 4K words, multiple
   contiguous Write or Read orders are used, with all but the last order having
   their data chain bits set.

   In simulation, IOCW bits 1-4 are used to index into a 16-element lookup table
   to produce the final I/O order (because some of the orders define IOCW bit 4
   as "don't care", there are only thirteen distinct orders).

   Channel-capable interfaces connect via the selector channel bus and request
   channel service by asserting the CHANSR signal.  An interface may initiate an
   I/O program on the channel only if the channel is not busy with a transfer
   involving another interface.  The SIO instruction microcode tests status bit
   0 ("SIO OK") from the interface before starting the I/O program.  This bit
   reflects the SIOENABLE signal from the channel, which is true only when the
   channel is idle.  If the channel is busy, the SIO instruction sets CCG and
   returns without disturbing the channel.

   The channel uses double-buffering for both data and I/O program words,
   allowing concurrent channel/interface and channel/memory transfers.
   Prefetching of the next I/O program word increases channel speed by reducing
   the wait on memory transfers.

   In simulation, an interface is implicitly connected to the selector channel
   bus by calling the "sel_assert_REQ" routine.  This initiates the transfer
   between the device number of the interface and the channel.  The
   "service_request" field in the DIB is not used (it must be set to the
   SRNO_UNUSED value).

   The channel simulator provides these global objects:

     t_bool sel_is_idle

       TRUE if the selector channel is idle; FALSE otherwise.  Corresponds to
       the hardware SIOENABLE signal and reflects the value of the Selector
       Active flip-flop.  Used by device interfaces to qualify their SIO OK
       status bits.

     sel_assert_REQ (DIB *)

       Called by the device interface while processing a DSTARTIO signal to
       request that the selector channel begin an SIO operation, or called at
       any time while the channel is active to abort the operation.  Corresponds
       to asserting the REQ signal.  If the channel is idle, it initializes the
       channel and starts the sequencer.  If the channel is active, it aborts
       the I/O program execution and idles the channel.

     sel_assert_CHANSR (DIB *)

       Called by the device controller to request service from the selector
       channel asynchronously.  Corresponds to asserting the CHANSR signal.
       Typically called from a device service routine; device controller
       interface routines return the CHANSR signal to request service
       synchronously.  Sets the service_request flag in the DIB and sets
       sel_request.

     t_bool sel_request

       TRUE if an interface is requesting service from the selector channel or
       the channel is servicing an internal request; FALSE otherwise.
       Corresponds to the CHANSR signal received by the channel.  Used by the
       CPU to determine if a request is pending and the selector channel service
       routine should be called.

     sel_initialize (void)

       Called in the instruction execution prelude to allow devices to be
       reassigned or reset.  If a device is under channel control, the routine
       reestablishes the device number for the channel.  It also sets
       sel_request TRUE if the device has a service request pending or FALSE
       otherwise.

     sel_service (uint32)

       Called to service a request from the device interface or an internal
       request from the selector channel.  Executes one or more channel cycles
       for the associated interface.  Used by the CPU to run the selector
       channel.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, the installed memory size must be set with jumper S3 on the
       Selector Channel Register PCA.  In simulation, the size is determined by
       using the MEMSIZE macro that tests the "capac" field of the CPU unit.

    2. Multiple channels and interleaved memory operation and its associated
       configuration jumpers are not supported.

    3. The selectable trigger/freeze and error logging register features of the
       Selector Channel Control PCA are not supported.  Debug tracing may be
       enabled to determine why an I/O program aborted.

    3. The selector channel must execute more than one I/O order per CPU
       instruction in order to meet the timing requirements of the diagnostic.
       The timing is modeled by establishing a count of channel clock pulses at
       poll entry and then executing orders until the count is exhausted.  If
       the clock count was exceeded, the excess count is saved and then
       subtracted from the next entry's count, so that the typical execution
       time is preserved over a number of entries.

/* Program constants.

   The selector channel clock period is 175 nanoseconds.  The channel runs
   concurrently with the CPU, which executes instructions in an average of 2.57
   microseconds, so multiple cycles are executed per CPU instruction.

   In simulation, the channel is called from the instruction execution loop
   after every instruction, and sometimes additionally within instructions that
   have long execution times (e.g., MOVE).  The number of event ticks that have
   elapsed since the last call are passed to the channel; this determines the
   number of channel cycles to execute.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The number of cycles consumed by the channel for various operations are
       educated guesses.  There is no documentation available that details the
       cycle timing.

    2. In simulation, the Wait Sequence exists separately from the Transfer
       Sequence only to avoid cancelling the SR wait timer for each word
       transferred.  It is reported as a Transfer Sequence cycle.

   This routine is called in the CPU instruction execution prelude to allow the
   device number of the participating interface to be reassigned.  It also sets
   up the service request value from the device DIB.  This allows the device
   state to be changed during a simulation stop.

   Implementation notes:

    1. The active DIB pointer is restored from the device context to support
       resuming after a SAVE and RESTORE is performed.

    2. In simulation, we allow the device number to be changed during a
       simulation stop, so this routine must recover it from the device.
       Normally, the device number register would be reset from the device
       number field in the DIB.  However, the SCMB may be spoofing the device
       number, and it is this spoofed number that must be restored.  To do this,
       we first assert the DEVNODB signal to the interface.  The SCMB will
       respond to the DEVNODB signal, as it supports connection to the
       multiplexer channel.  Devices that connect only to the selector channel
       will not respond to DEVNODB, returning an outbound value of zero.  In
       this case, we use the DIB field to obtain the device number.

/* Start an I/O program.

   This routine is called by a device interface in response to a Start I/O (SIO)
   instruction to request that the selector channel begin an I/O program.  It
   corresponds in hardware to asserting the REQ signal.

   If REQ is asserted while the channel is servicing the interface, the channel
   aborts the transfer.  This occurs when an interface decides to terminate a
   transfer, for example when an error retry count has expired or a device has
   become not ready.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Both the HP 3000 Series II/III System Reference Manual and the HP 3000
       Series III Reference/Training manuals say that the selector channel
       asserts a DEVNODB signal as part of the REQ processing.  This is
       incorrect; the DEVNODB line is tied inactive by the channel, per the
       Selector Channel Control PCA schematic.  Instead, the channel expects the
       device number, multiplied by four, to be present on the SRn bus during
       REQ signal assertion, when it is loaded into the device number register.
       Selector channel devices gate their device numbers onto SR6-13 when an
       SIO instruction is decoded.

/* Invoke the channel sequencer in response to a service request.

   This routine is called in the CPU instruction execution loop to service a
   channel request, asserted either by the participating interface, or
   generated internally by the channel.  It executes one or more channel cycles
   for the associated device interface and resets the service request flag in
   the DIB before exiting.  The routine is called after every instruction, and
   sometimes additionally within instructions that have long execution times
   (e.g., MOVE).  The number of event ticks that have elapsed since the last
   call are passed in; this determines the number of channel cycles available to
   execute.

   The selector channel clock period is 175 nanoseconds.  The channel runs
   concurrently with the CPU, which executes instructions in an average of 2.57
   microseconds, so multiple cycles are executed per CPU instruction.

   On entry, the routine executes the next state in the transfer for the
   currently participating interface.  The number of channel clock counts
   consumed for the specified state execution is subtracted from the number of
   clock counts available.  If more time remains, and the service request is
   still active, another channel cycle is run for the interface.

   A fundamental difference between the multiplexer and selector channels is
   that the latter needs an external service request (i.e., CHANSR assertion)
   only for operations on the interface.  All other channel operations apply an
   internal service request and so occur automatically without CHANSR being
   asserted.  In simulation, sel_request is set TRUE during channel
   initialization and is only cleared when the channel is waiting for a response
   from the interface during a control, read, or write operation.  The following
   signal assertions to the interface must return CHANSR to permit the channel
   sequencer to advance:

     - PCMD1
     - PCONTSTB
     - TOGGLEINXFER | READNEXTWD
     - PREADSTB
     - TOGGLEOUTXFER
     - PWRITESTB

   Because the channel is dedicated to an interface for the duration of a
   transfer, a non-responding interface would tie up the channel forever.  To
   prevent this, the channel starts a one-millisecond timer whenever it is
   waiting for the interface to assert CHANSR.  If the timer expires, the
   transfer is aborted, and the channel is freed.  The channel also checks for
   CHANACK in response to CHANSO assertion to the interface and will terminate
   (but not abort) the transfer if the interface fails to return it.

   To maintain the maximum transfer rate across chained read or write transfers,
   the channel will attempt to prefetch the next set of I/O Control and Address
   words during the current data transfer.  The two memory reads are interleaved
   between successive channel data transfers, but only if the input or output
   data buffers are both empty (read) or full (write), respectively.  This will
   normally occur unless the device is using all available channel bandwidth;
   the SCMB in high speed mode is an example of a device that asserts SR
   continuously.

   The selector channel diagnostic checks for the expected prefetching.  With
   the SCMB in slow mode, both the control and address prefetches will occur
   within three (read) or five (write) I/O cycles.  In fast mode, prefetches are
   locked out during a write operation, and only the control word prefetch
   occurs during a read operation.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Conceptually, the selector channel has three internal states: initiate,
       fetch, and execute.  The initiator sequence begins with a REQ
       assertion from the interface and sets up the I/O program for execution.
       The fetch sequence obtains the IOCW and IOAW.  The execute sequence
       generates the signals needed for each I/O order.

       In hardware, the Selector Channel Sequencer PCA contains several state
       machines (initiator, fetch, prefetch, buffer transfer, etc.) that provide
       substates.  In simulation, the prefetch, transfer, and reload actions are
       given separate states, rather than making them substates of the execute
       state.

    2. In hardware, a ten-microsecond CHANACK timer is started when CHANSO is
       asserted to the interface.  In simulation, a timer is not needed;
       instead, the interface must return CHANACK to avoid a CHANACK timeout
       error.

    3. In hardware, the CHANACK and CHANSR timers run on every channel cycle.
       In simulation, CHANACK is tested only during a read or write transfer,
       and CHANSR is tested only at the beginning of a read or write transfer,
       and at the beginning and end of a control transfer.  This limits overhead
       while passing the diagnostic and providing some measure of protection.

    4. In hardware, there are two input and two output buffers.  This enables
       memory transfers to overlap with interface data transfers.  In
       simulation, only one of each buffer is implemented, and memory transfers
       occur synchronously with interface transfers.

    5. In hardware, prefetches of the IOCW and IOAW are interleaved with channel
       memory accesses and only occur when the port controller is idle.  In
       simulation, prefetches are not counted against the sequencer execution
       time.  Normal fetches, by contrast, wait for memory access and so the
       time taken is counted.

    6. The default label in the Execute Sequence switch statement is necessary
       to quiet a warning that inbound_signals may be used uninitialized, even
       though all cases are covered.
