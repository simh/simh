   Implementation Note -- Compiling the Simulator as C++
   -----------------------------------------------------

   Although simulators are written in C, the SIMH project encourages developers
   to compile them with a C++ compiler to obtain the more careful type checking
   provided.  To obtain successful compilations, the simulator must be written
   in the subset of C that is also valid C++.  Using valid C features beyond
   that subset, as the HP 3000 simulator does, will produce C++ compiler errors.

   The standard C features used by the simulator that prevent error-free C++
   compilation are:

    1. Incomplete types.

       In C, mutually recursive type definitions are allowed by the use of
       incomplete type declarations, such as "DEVICE ms_dev;" followed later by
       "DEVICE ms_dev {...};".  Several HP device simulators use this feature to
       place a pointer to the device structure in the "desc" field of an MTAB
       array element, typically when the associated validation or display
       routine handles multiple devices.  As the DEVICE contains a pointer to
       the MTAB array, and an MTAB array element contains a pointer to the
       DEVICE, the definitions are mutually recursive, and incomplete types are
       employed.  C++ does not permit incomplete types.

    2. Implicit conversion of ints to enums.

       In C, enumeration types are compatible with integer types, and its
       members are constants having type "int".  As such, they are semantically
       equivalent to and may be used interchangeably with integers.  For the
       developer, though, C enumerations have some advantages.  In particular,
       the compiler may check a "switch" statement to ensure that all of the
       enumeration cases are covered.  Also, a mathematical set may be modeled
       by an enumeration type with disjoint enumerator values, with the bitwise
       integer OR and AND operators modeling the set union and intersection
       operations.  The latter has direct support in the "gdb" debugger, which
       will display an enumerated type value as a union of the various
       enumerators.  The HP simulator makes extensive use of both features to
       model hardware signal buses (e.g., INBOUND_SET, OUTBOUND_SET) and so
       performs bitwise integer operations on the enumerations to model signal
       assertion and denial.  In C++, implicit conversion from enumerations to
       integers is allowed, but conversion from integers to enumerations is
       illegal without explicit casts.  Therefore, the idiom employed by the
       simulator to assert a signal (e.g., "outbound_signals |= INTREQ") is
       rejected by the C++ compiler.

    3. Implicit increment operations on enums.

       Because enums are compatible with integers in C, no special enumerator
       increment operator is provided.  To cycle through the range of an
       enumeration type, e.g. in a "for" statement, the standard integer
       increment operator, "++", is used.  In C++, the "++" operator must be
       overloaded with a version specific to the enumeration type; applying the
       integer "++" to an enumeration is illegal.

    4. Use of C++ keywords as variable names.

       C++ reserves a number of additional keywords beyond those reserved by C.
       Use of any of these keywords as a variable or type name is legal C but
       illegal C++.  The HP simulator uses variables named "class" and
       "operator", which are keywords in C++.

   The HP simulator is written in ISO standard C and will compile cleanly with a
   compiler implementing the 1999 C standard.  Compilation as C++ is not a goal
   of the simulator and cannot work, given the incompatibilities listed above.

/* The following pragmas quell clang and Microsoft Visual C++ warnings that are
   on by default but should not be, in my opinion.  They warn about the use of
   perfectly valid code and require the addition of redundant parentheses and
   braces to silence them.  Rather than clutter up the code with scores of extra
   symbols that, in my view, make the code harder to read and maintain, I elect
   to suppress these warnings.

/* Register macros.

   These additional register definition macros are used to define:

     FBDATA -- a one-bit flag in an arrayed register
     SRDATA -- an array of bytes large enough to hold a structure
     YRDATA -- a binary register

   The FBDATA macro defines a flag that is replicated in the same bit position
   in each element of an array; the array element size is assumed to be the
   minimum necessary to hold the bit at the given offset.  The SRDATA macro is
   used solely to SAVE data stored in a structure so that it may be RESTOREd
   later.  The YRDATA macro extends the functionality of the ORDATA, DRDATA, and
   HRDATA macros to registers with binary (base 2) representation.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Use caution that multiple FBDATA registers referencing the same array
       have offsets that imply the same array element size.  For example,
       offsets of 3 and 5 can be used with an array of 8-bit elements, and
       offsets 13 and 15 can be used with an array of 16-bit elements.  However,
       offsets 3 and 13 cannot be used, as the first implies 8-bit elements, and
       the second implies 16-bit elements.

    2. The macro names are UNDEFed to avoid potential name clashes with
       sim_def.h macros.

    3. The REG structure for version 4.0 contains several fields that are not
       present in 3.x versions.  The 4.x REGDATA macro maps to the REG strcture
       in a field-order- and preprocessor-independent manner.  There is no
       corresponding macro in 3.x, so we must handle standard vs. non-standard
       preprocessor differences by creating our own REGMAP macro to handle the
       mapping.

/* Debugging and console output.

   "dprintf" is used to write debugging messages.  It does an "fprintf" to the
   debug output stream if the stream is open and the debug "flag" is currently
   enabled in device "dev".  Otherwise, it's a NOP.  "..." is the format string
   and associated values.

   "dpprintf" is identical to "dprintf", except that a device pointer is passed
   instead of a device structure.

   "DPRINTING" and "DPPRINTING" implement the test conditions for device and
   device pointer debugging, respectively.  They are used explicitly only when
   several debug statements employing the same flag are required, and it is
   desirable to avoid repeating the stream and flag test for each one.

   "cprintf", "cputs", and "cputc" are used to write messages to the console
   and, if console logging is enabled, to the log output stream.  They do
   "(f)printf", "fputs", or "(f)putc", respectively.  "..." is the format string
   and associated values, "str" is the string to write, and "ch" is the
   character to write.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The "cputs" macro uses "fputs" for both console and log file output
       because "puts" appends a newline, whereas "fputs" does not.

/* I/O event timing.

   I/O events are scheduled for future service by specifying the desired delay

   of one CPU instruction, and this is the way event ticks are defined in the
   current simulator implementation.  However, while the average execution time
   of a typical instruction mix on a Series II is given as 2.57 microseconds,
   actual instruction times vary greatly, due to the presence of block move and
   loop instructions.  Variations of an order of magnitude are common, and two
   orders or more are possible for longer blocks.

   To accommodate possible future variable instruction timing, I/O service
   activation times must not assume a constant 2.57 microseconds per event tick.
   Delays should be defined in terms of the "uS" (microseconds), "mS"
   (milliseconds), and "S" (seconds) macros below.

/* Architectural constants.

   These macros specify the width, sign location, value mask, and minimum and
   maximum signed and unsigned values for the data sizes supported by the
   simulator.  In addition, masks for 16-bit and 32-bit overflow are defined (an
   overflow is indicated if the masked bits are not all ones or all zeros).

   The HP_WORD type is used to declare variables that represent 16-bit registers
   or buses in hardware.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The HP_WORD type is a 32-bit unsigned type, instead of the more logical
       16-bit unsigned type.  There are two reasons for this.  First, SCP
       requires that scalars referenced by REG (register) entries be 32 bits in
       size.  Second, IA-32 processors execute instructions with 32-bit operands
       much faster than those with 16-bit operands.

       Using 16-bit operands omits the masking required for 32-bit values.  For
       example, the code generated for the following operations is as follows:

         uint16 a, b, c;
         a = b + c & 0xFFFF;

            movzwl  _b, %eax
            addw    _c, %ax
            movw    %ax, _a

         uint32 x, y, z;
         x = y + z & 0xFFFF;

            movl    _z, %eax
            addl    _y, %eax
            andl    $65535, %eax
            movl    %eax, _x

       However, the first case uses operand override prefixes, which require
       substantially more time to decode (6 clock cycles vs. 1 clock cycle).
       This time outweighs the additional 32-bit AND instruction, which executes
       in 1 clock cycle.

       On an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, defining HP_WORD as uint16 causes the
       HP 3000 memory diagnostic to run about 10% slower.

     - TO_BANK   -- extract the bank number part of a physical address
     - TO_OFFSET -- extract the offset part of a physical address


   Implementation notes:

    1. The TO_PA offset parameter is not masked to 16 bits, as this value is
       almost always derived from a value that is inherently 16 bits in size.
       In the few cases where it is not, explicit masking is required.

#define TO_OFFSET(p)        ((p) & LA_MASK)


/* Memory access classifications.

   The access classification determines which bank register is used with the
   supplied offset to access memory, whether or not the access is bounds
   checked, and whether or not the access is mapped to the TOS registers if the
   address is between SM and SM + SR.

   Bounds checking is optionally performed on program (including instruction
   fetch), data, and stack accesses when not in privileged mode.  Absolute
   addresses are always accessed in privileged mode, so bounds checking is never
   performed.

   If the memory address lies between SM and SM + SR within the stack bank, then
   access to the TOS registers may be substituted for access to memory.
   Register mapping is always performed on stack accesses, optionally performed
   on absolute and data accesses, and is never performed on program (and fetch)
   accesses.

   To summarize bounds checking and TOS register mapping:

               Bounds    TOS
     Access    Check   Mapping
     --------  ------  -------
     absolute    N        O
     fetch       O        N
     program     O        N
     data        O        O
     stack       O        Y
     dma         N        N


   Implementation notes:

    1. The enumeration values must be ordered such that the "checked" classes
       are odd and differ from their corresponding "unchecked" classes only in
       the LSBs.

    2. There is no hardware DMA bank register.  The "dma" class exists only to
       differentiate DMA memory accesses from CPU memory accesses when tracing.

/* Portable conversions.

   SIMH is written with the assumption that the defined-size types (e.g.,
   uint16) are at least the required number of bits but may be larger.
   Conversions that otherwise would make inherent size assumptions must instead
   be coded explicitly.  For example, doing:

     negative_value_32 = (int32) negative_value_16;

   ...will not guarantee that bits 0-15 of "negative_value_32" are ones, whereas
   the supplied sign-extension macro will.

   The conversions available are:

     - SEXT8  -- int8 sign-extended to int32
     - SEXT16 -- int16 sign-extended to int32
     - NEG16  -- int8 negated
     - NEG16  -- int16 negated
     - NEG32  -- int32 negated
     - INT16  -- uint16 to int16
     - INT32  -- uint32 to int32


   Implementation notes:

    1. The routines assume that 16-bit values are masked to exactly 16 bits
       before invoking.
