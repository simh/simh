   The HP 30003B I/O Processor is an integral part of the HP 3000 system.  It
   works in conjunction with the CPU and Multiplexer Channel to service the
   device interfaces.  All I/O interfaces are connected to the IOP bus, which
   transfers programmed I/O orders to the interfaces and handles memory reads
   and writes between the interfaces and the CPU stack.  In addition, it
   provides the memory interface for multiplexer channel transfers and fetches
   I/O program orders from main memory for the channel.

   Interrupt requests are serviced by the IOP, which asserts an external
   interrupt signal to the CPU.  Device controllers request interrupts via the
   IOP, which prioritizes the requests and grants service to the
   highest-priority interrupt.  While that interrupt is active, lower-priority
   requests are held off until it becomes inactive, whereupon the next
   highest-priority request is granted.  The device number of the interrupting
   device is stored in the IOP's address register; this is used by the CPU
   microcode to access the proper entry in the Device Reference Table, which
   contains the starting address of the I/O handler.

   In hardware, a device requests an interrupt by asserting INTREQ to the IOP.
   In response, the IOP polls the interfaces by asserting INTPOLLIN to determine
   the highest-priority request.  The INTPOLLIN and INTPOLLOUT signals are
   daisy-chained between interfaces, with the position of the interface in the
   chain establishing its priority.  Interfaces that are not requesting or
   processing interrupts pass INTPOLLIN to INTPOLLOUT.  The first interface in
   the chain that has an interrupt request pending will inhibit INTPOLLOUT and
   will set its Interrupt Active flip-flop.  As long as the interrupt is active,
   an interface will break the poll chain by denying INTPOLLOUT.  This holds off
   requests from lower-priority devices.

   To avoid scanning each interface's DIB for interrupt requests, the IOP
   simulator maintains two 32-bit vectors: a global "iop_interrupt_request_set"
   and a local "interrupt_poll_set".  Each bit is associated with an interrupt
   priority number from 0-31.  The bits of the request set indicate which
   interfaces are requesting interrupts, and the bits of the poll set indicate
   which interfaces will break the poll chain when they are polled.  The lowest
   set bit in each indicates the highest-priority interrupting device and the
   highest-priority device handler currently executing, respectively.  An
   interface requests an interrupt by asserting INTREQ to the IOP.  The IOP then
   sets the request and poll bits corresponding to that interface's interrupt
   priority number.  The CPU checks the request set periodically to determine if
   an external interrupt is present.

   A device's DIB (Device Information Block) contains three values that pertain
   to interrupts: the "interrupt_priority" value determines which bit is set or
   cleared in the bit vectors, the "interrupt_request" flip-flop indicates that
   the interface is requesting an interrupt from the IOP, and the
   "interrupt_active" flip-flop indicates that the device's interrupt handler is
   executing.  The two flip-flop values indicate one of four possible interrupt
   states that are reflected in the associated bit of the bit vectors:

     Interrupt  Interrupt  Request  Poll
      Request    Active      Set    Set   Interrupt State
     ---------  ---------  -------  ----  ------------------------------------
       CLEAR      CLEAR       0      0    Not interrupting
        SET       CLEAR       1      1    Interrupt requested
       CLEAR       SET        0      1    Interrupt acknowledged
        SET        SET        1      1    Interrupt requested while in handler

   The "requested" state corresponds to the device interface asserting the
   INTREQ signal to the IOP.  The "acknowledged" state corresponds to the IOP
   conducting a poll via INTPOLL IN and INTPOLL OUT, and the device interface
   responding by inhibiting INTPOLL OUT and asserting INTACK to the IOP.

   If both the request and active flip-flops are set, the device has requested a
   second interrupt while the first is still being processed.  The ATC TDI, for
   example, does this when a CIO is issued to acknowledge an interrupt before
   the IXIT sends an ioRIN to the interface to reset the active flip-flop.

   Device interfaces maintain the states of their interrupt flip-flops for the
   benefit of IOP initialization.  During the instruction execution prelude, the
   IOP will reconstruct its bit vectors from the DIB values.  Thereafter, the
   interfaces change their interrupt states in response to signals, and the IOP
   adjusts the bit vectors as needed.  The only direct interaction needed is an
   "iop_assert_INTREQ" call from the device interface when an interrupt is
   initially requested.

   The IOP does not have a programmable interface.  It is manipulated directly
   by the CPU microcode to issue direct I/O commands to the device interfaces,
   and by the multiplexer channel to transfer data and I/O programs to and from
   memory.

   Direct I/O instructions are sent via the IOP Bus to all device interfaces.
   When executing I/O instructions, the CPU microcode writes a 16-bit command
   word to the IOP, which then places bits 5-7 of that word onto the IOP Bus as
   IOCMD0-2 as follows:

         CPU      Command  IOCMD  Generated               Action
     Instruction   Word    0 1 2   Signal               Performed

         RIO      103400   1 1 1  DREADSTB   Read a data word

   The SIO instruction sends an SIO IOCMD to the device interface via the IOP
   to begin execution of a channel program.  The program consists of two-word
   programmed I/O orders, with each pair consisting of an I/O Control Word and
   an I/O Address Word.  They are encoded as follows:

       IOCW        IOCW            IOAW        Generated           Action
     0 1 2 3       4-15            0-15         Signal           Performed

     0 0 0 0  1 XXXXXXXXXXX   Jump Address    SETJMP       Conditional Jump
     0 0 0 1  0 XXXXXXXXXXX   Residue Count       --       Return Residue
     0 0 0 1  1 XXXXXXXXXXX   Bank Address        --       Set Bank

     C 1 1 0  Neg Word Count  Write Address   PWRITESTB    Write
     C 1 1 1  Neg Word Count  Read Address    PREADSTB     Read

   The "Unconditional Jump," "Return Residue," and "Set Bank" orders are
   executed entirely by the channel and are not sent to the device interface.

   The IOP simulator provides the capability to trace direct I/O commands and
   interrupt requests, as well as memory accesses made on behalf of the
   multiplexer channel.  Devices that periodically interrupt, such as the system
   clock, may generate a large number of trace events.  To accommodate this, a
   filter may be applied to remove trace events from devices that are not of
   interest.

   This routine is called in the instruction prelude to set up the IOP data

   pointers -- one indexed by device number, and a second indexed by interrupt
   request number.  This allows fast access to the device interface routine by
   the direct I/O instruction and interrupt poll processors, respectively.

   It also sets the interrupt request and poll bit vectors from the interrupt
   flip-flop values in the device DIBs and clears the external interrupt flag if
   there are no devices with active interrupts (as the user may have set the
   flag or reset the interrupting device during a simulation stop).

   The value of the IOA register is returned.  This is zero unless a device
   requesting an interrupt has been acknowledged but not yet serviced, in which
   case the value is the device number.

/* Poll the interfaces for an active interrupt request.

   This routine is called in the instruction loop when the request set indicates
   that one or more interrupt requests are pending.  It polls the interface
   asserting the highest-priority request.  If the interface acknowledges the
   interrupt, the routine sets the "external interrupt" bit in the CPU's CPX1
   register to initiate interrupt processing, sets the IOP's IOA register to the
   the device number of the interrupting device, and returns that value to the
   caller.

   In hardware, an interface requesting an interrupt with its Interrupt Mask
   flip-flop set will assert a common INTREQ to the IOP.  In response, the IOP
   polls the interfaces to determine the highest-priority request by asserting
   INTPOLLIN.  The INTPOLLIN and INTPOLLOUT signals are daisy-chained between
   interfaces, with the position of the interface in the chain establishing its
   priority.  Interfaces that are not requesting interrupts pass INTPOLLIN to
   INTPOLLOUT.  The first interface in the chain that has its Interrupt Request
   flip-flop set will inhibit INTPOLLOUT, set its Interrupt Active flip-flop,
   and assert INTACK to the IOP.

   To avoid polling interfaces in simulation, an interface will set the
   Interrupt Request flip-flop in its DIB and then call iop_assert_INTREQ.  That
   routine sets the request set and poll set bits corresponding to the interrupt
   priority value in the DIB.

   In the instruction execution loop, if external interrupts are enabled (i.e.,
   the I bit in the status word is set), and iop_interrupt_request_set has one
   or more bits set, this routine is called to select the interrupt request to
   service.

   The end of priority chain is marked by the highest-priority (lowest-order)
   poll bit that is set.  When a poll is performed, a priority mask is generated
   that contains just the highest-priority bit.  The device corresponding to
   that bit will then be the recipient of the current interrupt acknowledgement
   cycle.  After the interrupt request has been cleared, the poll bit will
   prevent lower-priority interrupts from being serviced.

   For example:

     poll set      : ...0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (poll denied at INTPRI 6 and 9)
     priority mask : ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (poll stops at INTPRI 6)

   The request is then ANDed with the priority mask to determine if a request is
   to be granted:

     pri mask      : ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (allowed interrupt source)
     request set   : ...0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (devices requesting interrupts)
     ANDed value   : ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (request to grant = INTPRI 6)

   Once the interrupt request has been cleared, the poll state is:

     poll set      : ...0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (poll denied at INTPRI 6 and 9)
     priority mask : ...0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  (poll stops at INTPRI 6)
     request set   : ...0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  (devices requesting interrupts)
     ANDed value   : ...0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  (request to grant = none)

   INTPRI 9 will continue to be held off until INTPRI 6 completes its interrupt
   handler and resets the Interrupt Active flip-flop on its interface, which
   also clears the associated poll set bit.  At the next poll, INTPRI 9 will be
   granted.

   This routine determines the request to grant, converts that back to an
   interrupt priority number, and uses that to index into the table of DIBs.
   The interface routine associated with the DIB is called with INTPOLLIN
   asserted.

   If the interface still has its Interrupt Request flip-flop set, it
   will assert INTACK and return the device number.  In response, the IOP will
   save the device number in IOA, set the external interrupt bit in CPX1, and
   return the device number to the CPU.  This will cause the CPU to service the
   interrupt.

   However, if some condition has occurred between the time of the original
   request and this poll, the interface will assert INTPOLLOUT.  In response,
   the IOP will clear IOA and the associated bit in the poll set to cancel the
   request.

   In either case, the associated bit in the request set is cleared.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The hardware inhibits the interrupt poll if the EXTINT flip-flop is set.
       This prevents a second interrupt from changing IOA until the microcode
       signals its readiness by clearing EXTINT.  In simulation, entry with
       cpx1_EXTINTR set returns IOA in lieu of conducting a poll.

/* Dispatch an I/O command to an interface.

   This routine is called by the CPU when executing direct I/O instructions
   to send I/O orders to the indicated device interface.  It translates the
   "io_cmd" value to the appropriate I/O signal and calls the signal handler of
   the device interface indicated by the "device_number" with the supplied
   "write_value".  The handler return value, if any, is returned as the function
   value.  If the supplied device number does not correspond to an enabled
   device, the I/O Timeout bit in CPX1 is set.

   A "Set Interrupt Mask" order is sent to all active interfaces; the supplied
   device number is ignored.  If there are none, the I/O Timeout bit is set.
   All of the other orders are sent only to the specified device.  A "Reset
   Interrupt" order clears the corresponding bit from the poll set, unless there
   is a request pending on the device (which may occur if a second interrupt was
   requested while the first was still being processed).


   Implementation notes:

    1. For a "Set Interrupt Mask" order, it would be faster to cycle through the
       sim_devices array to find the active devices.  However, we use the devs
       array so that interfaces are accessed in DEVNO order, which makes traces
       easier to follow.  This is an acceptable tradeoff, as the SMSK
       instruction is used infrequently.

/* Device reset routine.

   This routine is called for a RESET or RESET IOP command.  It is the
   simulation equivalent of the IORESET signal, which is asserted by the front
   panel LOAD and DUMP switches.


   Implementation notes:

    1. In hardware, IORESET clears flip-flops associated with the state machines
       that implement the interrupt poll, SO/SI handshake, and multiplexer
       channel access.  In simulation, these are all represented by function
       calls and, as such, are atomic.  Therefore, the only state variable that
       IORESET clears is the external interrupt flip-flop, which is implemented
       as its respective bit in the CPX1 register rather than as a separate
       variable.  Setting IOA to 0 and calling iop_initialize clears this bit;
       it also sets up the devs array, which is used by the POWER FAIL command.

    2. In hardware, IORESET also clears the IOP address parity error, system
       parity error, and illegal address flip-flops.  However, these exist only
       to assert XFERERROR to devices.  In simulation, XFERERROR is sent to a
       device interface when the initiating condition is detected by the
       multiplexer channel, so these are not represented by state variables.

IOA = 0;                                                /* clear the I/O Address register and initialize */

/* Set the trace omission filter.

   If the "value" parameter is 1, the filter array bits corresponding to the
   device number(s) in the buffer referenced by the "cptr" parameter are set to
   exclude those devices from the trace listing.  If the "value" parameter is 0,
   the filter array is reset to include all devices.  The unit and descriptor
   pointer parameters are not used.

   Each bit of the four, 32-bit filter array elements corresponds to a device
   number from 0-127, with the LSB of the first element representing device 0,
   and the MSB of the last element representing device 127.  A set bit enables
   tracing of that device.  The filter starts out with all bits set, implying
   that all devices are traced.  Specifying device numbers to filter out clears
   the corresponding bits.

   Example filter commands:

      SET IOP FILTER=3         --  omit tracing for device 3.
      SET IOP FILTER=4;7-9;11  --  omit tracing for devices 4, 7, 8, 9, and 11.
      SET IOP FILTER=ALL       --  omit tracing for all devices
      SET IOP NOFILTER         --  restore tracing for all devices

   On entry, the "cptr" parameter points to the first character of the range
   specification, which may be either a semicolon-separated list of device
   number ranges or the keyword ALL.  Each range is parsed and added to the new
   filter array.  Once the entire array has been set, it is copied over the old
   filter.  If an error occurs during parsing, the original filter set is not
   disturbed.
