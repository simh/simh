                        - Fixed missing information from save/restore which
                          caused operations to not complete correctly after

                          (in and out) to sometimes not interrupt the CPU after processing.
                        - Fixed the SCP visibile SA registers to always display the 
                          ROM mac address, even after it is changed by SET XQ MAC=.
                        - Added changes so that the Console DELQA diagnostic (>>>TEST 82) 
                          will succeed.
                        - Added DELQA-T (aka DELQA Plus) device emulation support.
                        - Added dropped frame statistics to record when the receiver discards
                          received packets due to the receiver being disabled, or due to the
                          XQ device's packet receive queue being full.
                        - Fixed bug in receive processing when we're not polling.  This could
                          cause receive processing to never be activated again if we don't 
                          read all available packets via eth_read each time we get the 
                          opportunity.
                        - Added the ability to Coalesce received packet interrupts.  This
                          is enabled by SET XQ POLL=DELAY=nnn where nnn is a number of 
                          microseconds to delay the triggering of an interrupt when a packet
                          is received.
                        - Added SET XQ POLL=DISABLE (aka SET XQ POLL=0) to operate without 
                          polling for packet read completion.
                        - Changed the sanity and id timer mechanisms to use a separate timer
                          unit so that transmit and recieve activities can be dealt with
                          by the normal xq_svc routine.
                          Dynamically determine the timer polling rate based on the 
                          calibrated tmr_poll and clk_tps values of the simulator.
                        - Enabled the SET XQ POLL to be meaningful if the simulator currently
                          doesn't support idling.

7       2-Oct-01        pdp11_rp.c, pdp10_rp.c: CS1_SC is evaluated as a level-
                           sensitive, rather than an edge-sensitive, input to
                           interrupt request

6       30-Sep-01       pdp11_rp.c, pdp10_rp.c: separated out CS1<5:0> to per-
                           drive registers

                        pdp10_tu.c: based on above, cleaned up handling of
                           non-existent formatters, fixed non-data transfer
                           commands clearing DONE

5       28-Sep-01       pdp11_rp.c, pdp10_rp.c, pdp10_tu.c: controller should
                           interrupt if ATA or SC sets when IE is set, was
                           interrupting only if DON = 1 as well

4       27-Sep-01       pdp11_ts.c:
                        - NXM errors should return TC4 or TC5; were returning TC3
                        - extended features is part of XS2; was returned in XS3
                        - extended characteristics (fifth) word needed for RSTS/E

                        pdp11_tc.c: stop, stop all do cause an interrupt

                        dec_dz.h: scanner should find a ready output line, even
                           if there are no connections; needed for RSTS/E autoconfigure

                        scp.c:
                        - added routine sim_qcount for 1130
                        - added "simulator exit" detach routine for 1130

                        sim_defs.h: added header for sim_qcount

3       20-Sep-01       pdp11_ts.c: boot code binary was incorrect

2       19-Sep-01       pdp18b_cpu.c: EAE should interpret initial count of 00
                           as 100

                        scp.c: modified Macintosh support

1       17-Sep-01       pdp8_ttx.c: new module for PDP-8 multi-terminal support

                        pdp18b_tt1.c: modified to use sim_tmxr library

                        nova_tt1.c: modified to use sim_tmxr library

                        dec_dz.h: added autodisconnect support

                        scp.c: removed old multiconsole support

                        sim_tmxr.c: modified calling sequence for sim_putchar_ln

                        sim_sock.c: added Macintosh sockets support
