Diagnostic Notes
----------------

1. PATTERN paper tape (SA = 60, end pass = 1AC), SET CPU RBLKS=32.
   Break at 60 is triggered once during loading process.
2. VERIFY paper tape (SA = 140, end pass = 8E6).
3. AUTO paper tape (SA = 105), SET CPU LASLMS to suppress spurious error message.
   AUTO magtape runs correctly with no messages.
4. SUFFIX magtape (SA = 100, end pass = 115), no printouts.
5. FLOAT magtape.
6. DECIMAL paper tape (SA = EE).
7. PROTECT paper tape (SA = F9), long runtime until printout.
8. MAP paper tape (SA = 7C).
9. MEDIC paper tape (SA = 68), set SSW2 after breakpoint, long runtime.
10. INT magtape, stops after M6, set SSW2 and continue,
   enters pattern generator and loops forever, as expected.
11. RTC paper tape, clocks must be 500Mhz, reports clocks as "too slow" due
   to faster simulation speed.
   Runs correctly with SET THROTTLE 500K.
