/* The KS timer works off a 4.100 MHz (243.9024 nsec) oscillator that
 * is independent of all other system timing.
 *
 * Two pieces of timekeeping hardware are exposed to the OS.
 *  o The interval timer, which can interrupt at a programmed interval.
 *  o The timebase, which records time (71 bits).
 *
 * The clock is architecturally readable in units of 243.9024 nsec via
 * the timebase.  The implementation is somewhat different.
 *
 * The instructions that update the clocks specify time in these units.
 *
 * However, both timekeepers are incremented by the microcode when
 * a 12 bit counter overflows; e.g. at a period of 999.0244 usec.
 * Thus, the granularity of timer interrupts is approximately 1 msec.
 *
 * The OS programs the interval timer to interrupt as though the
 * the 12 least significant bits mattered.  Thus, for a (roughly)
 * 1 msec interval, it would program 1 * 4096 into the interval timer.
 * The sign bit is not used, so 35-12 = 23 bits for the maximum interval,
 * which is 139.674 minutes.  If any of the least significant bits
 * are non-zero, the interval is extended by 1 * 4096 counts.
 *
 * The timer merely sets the INTERVAL DONE flag in the APR flags.
 * Whether that actually causes an interrupt is controlled by the
 * APR interrupt enable for the flag and by the  PI system.
 * 
 * The flag is readable as an APR condition by RDAPR, and CONSO/Z APR,.
 * The flag is cleared by WRAPR 1b22!1b30 (clear, count done).
 *
 * The timebase is maintained with the 12 LSB zero in a workspace
 * register.  When read by the OS, the actual value of the 10 MSB of 
 * the hardware counter is inserted into those bits, providing increased
 * resolution.  Although the system reference manual says otherwise, the
 * two LSB of the counter are read as zero by the microcode (DPM2), so
 * bits <70:71> of the timebase are also read as zero by software.
 *
 * When the OS sets the timebase, the 12 LSB that it supplies are ignored.
 *
 * The timebase is typically used for accurate time of day and CPU runtime
 * accounting.  The simulator adjusts the equivalent of the 12-bit counter,
 * so CPU time will reflect simulator wall clock, not simulated machine cycles.
 * Since time of day must be accurate, this may result in the OS reporting
 * CPU times that are unrealistically faster - or slower - than on the
 * real hardware.
 *
 * This module also implements the TCU, a battery backed-up TOY clock
 * that was supported by TOPS-10, but not sold by DEC.
