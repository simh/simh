Bugs Found and Fixed During Simulator Debug

1. pushj cleared T2 after setting it
2. if timer autoadjust is enabled, timer diagnostic may fail,
   depending on host CPU speed
3. DFAD/DFSB should use FP_ONES instead of ONES
4. TLB physical address max = 1MW, tested in diagnostic
5. DPB does read/write, not read-modify/write
6. Fetch error takes priority over traps, due to prefetching
   of next instruction
7. HSB is 36b, was 32b
8. CPU and PAG devices had mismatched types
9. non-zero sections in Tops-20 paging section indirect may
   cause non-existent memory error, due to microcode "error"
10. PXCT test for user mode was backward
11. Timer interrupts were not implemented in Tops-20 indirect
   chains
12. epta/upta hit known bug in VC++ implementation of 64b
   data types
13. final W calculation in Tops-20 paging was incorrect
14. Timer representation lost sub msec values
15. UBA initialization reset the UBA itself
16. RHCS1: writing IE cannot trigger an interrupt
17. Tape bootstrap was set to 800bpi instead of 1600bpi
18. FIXR off by 1 in testing for lower limit to process
19. Indirect loops and XCT loops should run indefinitely,
    test for interrupts on each memory reference
