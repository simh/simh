Config11 is a program for calculating the floating address space layout of
a PDP-11 or VAX.

Config11 is an interactive program.  When started, it repeatedly asks for
the names of controllers and the numbers of instances:

To end input, simply type ENTER to the NAME: prompt.  Config11 will then
print out the complete floating address table for the known Unibus and
Qbus devices.
