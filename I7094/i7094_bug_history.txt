Bugs Found and Fixed During Simulator Debug

1. CPU: MPY tested sign of AC instead of sign of MQ.
2. CPU: VLM, VDP, VDH need alternate opcode decode points for large counts.
3. CPU: STL not in decode table.
4. CPU: Partial stores lacked initial read in decode table.
5. CPU: PXD, PCD needed (t_uint64) cast.
6. CPU: SXD, SCD needed (t_uint64) cast.
7. CPU: SBM at wrong case offset.
8. CPU: All transfers used IR<21:35> instead of calculated effective address.
9. CPU: HPR, TRA need alternate negative opcodes.
10. CPU: STT missing final write to memory.
11. IO: Channel output process model incorrect, extensive revision required.
12. IO: Channel connect test should not test channel state, only connection.
13. IO: Channel opcode with nostore doesn't increment channel address.
14. CDR: Card reader missing activate at end of state 2.
15. SYS: Zero operand instructions printed with trailing space.
16. CPU: Convert class count bit field start definition incorrect.
17. CPU: CAQ cut and paste error from CVR.
18. CPU: Shift count is 8b wide, not 9b.
19. SYS: Mnemonic is LDQ not LMQ.
20. SYS: RQL opcode incorrect in symbolic decode table.
21. CPU: Multi-tag mode stores OR'd value of tags on any index read except
    normal effective address.
22. CPU: Floating point trap does not write location 0 if trap suppressed.
23. SYS: TRA instructions should have symbolic class MXN not MXR.
24. CPU: Floating add instructions test for zero result only if normalization enabled.
25. CPU: Floating add with unlike signs and equal magnitudes, result sign is sign
    of SR rather than sign of AC.
26. CPU: Floating multiply does not test spill prior to normalization step.
27. CPU: Channel activity proceeds under HALT.
28. MT: Any read error should stop the channel and the tape controller.
29. MT: EOR write flag cleared before testing.
39. IO: EOR write flag set after data sent to device.
40. IO: EOR write flag incorrect set on IOCP, IOCT, IOSP, IOST.
41. MT: End of file errors not masked on backspace operations.
42. CPU: LCHx, RCHx miscoded in decode table.
43. IO: Only 7607 error completions (IOxT without new command) set trap.
44. CPU: 7067 channel trap flags misdefined with extraneous decrement shift.
45. CPU: pcq array misdeclared as uint32 instead of uint16.
46. IO: SDC and SCD tested chan_flags instead of chan_dev.flags.
47. SYS: 7907 opcodes defined incorrectly.
48. SYS: TCH not decoding bit<19>.
49. IO: CTL not clearing EOR after device end.
50. DSK: Format code not incrementing track in writing all tracks in cylinder.
51. DSK: THA mode overwrites record structure of first record.
52. DSK: Write doesn't set channel request for initial word.
53. DSK: Saved record number was command digits 3..8 instead of 5..10.
54. CLK: Compute 60th's from location 5, so Chrono clock is in sync with interval clock.
55. CPU: Enable Chronolog clock if CTSS.
56. CPU: Read/write protection error not setting protection trap.
57. CPU: SCHx not setting protection trap in user mode.
58: CPU: Protection trap overwriting wrong location.
59. CPU: Stop message reporting physical, not virtual, PC.
60. IO: Test for "request another cycle" in channel processor was inverted.
61. IO: Valid bit handling incorrect across multiple transfers.
62. IO: BSR doesn't set EOF indicator.
63. IO: 7607 channel modeled incorrectly, could stall.
64. IO: All 7607 "effective NOP" conditions must be tested when a new command is
    decoded (wc == 0 for IOCx and IOSx, EOR set for IOSx and IORx).
